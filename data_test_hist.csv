"THE IRISH POOR LAW - If proof were wanting of the proposition that Ireland would be most benefitted by availing herself in full of the aid of powerful England, instead of relying on her own local agitators, Mr. O'Connell's newest production, his letter on the Irish Poor Law, would furnish it. For the nonce he waves the direct discussion of repeal- but he does net give up that main object of his present efforts. Now, if the union were repealed, Mr. O'Connell would inevitably be a leading man in the country - a chief lawgiver; and here is a test of his qualifications for the office. Be it never forgotten that Mr. O'Connell was greatly instrumental in obtaining Catholic emancipation for his country - a service which can scarcely be overrated, unless it be repaid by giving him license and opportunity to do his beloved country all the injury which his wayward fancy can devise. He opposed the passing of the Irish Poor Law, as he had a right to do. He has a right also to revive the discussion, as he now does: if he thinks it worthwhile to put forth a tissue of assertions, the gist of which is that spontaneous charity is a better provision for the destitute than a national relief under proper regulations, one can only wish him a less idle employment for his talents than the simple contradiction of what all the best authorities have declared in favor of. But that more harmless matter is introduced by the suggestive warning, that unless the present system of Poor Law abolished, ""it will produce a sanguinary an: general insurrection -"" and with the still more mischievous admission, that resisting the law to the death is a venal offence-"". Blood, alas, has been shed; and, taking it for granted that the slayers on the recent occasion were as guiltless as the circumstances would admit, yet that very fact may, perhaps, gave to 'ever' thinking mind a stronger impression of impending perils;' in the qualified allowance for the police, who resisted a tumultuous mob arrayed against the law is conveyed to the excitable Irish people the assurance that the guilt was on the side of those who enforced the law. With that implied license to the working Irish Mr. O'Connell's letter couples a set railing against the landlords of Ireland. Such is the temper of the ""pacificator,' what are his measures? Either the total repeal of the Poor-Law, followed by an augmentation of medical charities and a multiplication of other charities, or a poor rate on income, all incomes to be exempt which are below 500 a year; the rate to augment proportionately as the income rises, 'until, if necessary, it should be 50 per cent. upon the enormous income of absentee proprietors ""Such is the measure of justice which O'Connell promises to the Anglo-Saxon part of the Irish people, if his repeal of the union were carried out, and it is proposed as principle of practical and judicious legislation, that persons whose incomes are under 3001. £ year should be held exempt from all shares in the support of their destitute countrymen. Perhaps 'Mr. O'Connell's letter had no greater object than to absorb into the repeal ranks the anti-Poor Law body which he thinks he sees growing up in Ireland. But he could not plead that to withdraw his letter from criticism: it is either a very-unbecoming trick, or it is a specimen of the measures which he would think wise; and, accepting it in the latter sense, it is a sample of the legislation to be expected from the college-green parliament, could that by possibility be restored. Being so, it may be put to sensible men in Ireland, whether they had not rather cultivate a more intimate union with England, and a more thorough extension of the English government to their land, than have heaps of legislation like this sample? Probably the best antagonism to the repeal agitation- which is not harmless because it is an agitation would be a combined effort to draw close the union with England; to abolish the lord-lientenancy, for instance, and place Ireland, like Scotland directly under the Home-office."
"The late selfish attempt to merge the cause of the Irish poor in that of factious Radicalism and repeal is in nothing more forcibly illustrated than in the fact that the leader of the repeal agitation confounds together, with willful sophistry, the two distinct principles, distinct as light and darkness, of the old and of the present Poor Law systems. In the genuine spirit of Whig political economy, Mr. O'Connell thinks that by some legislative quackery, some Parliamentary legerdemain, all the poor may be made to cease from the land rental be made independent and of ""easy circumstances,"" and that thus no poor law whatsoever will be necessary. In the same spirit, he conceives that all public charity is necessarily nothing else than an encouragement to idleness and improvidence and proceeds very summarily and with some impudence of ingenuity to impute the parsimonious extravagance and the costly cruelty of the present system es essentials to aU poor laws whatsoever. We should, of course, be the last person to hint any suspicion that there may lurk a disinterested wish to cut off from the poor all legal claim to support at the hands of the rich, under the pretext of destroying the present cumbrous and expensive machine for driving the poor from cabin to workhouse, and from workhouse back to the cabin, at each other's expense,-we cannot, of course, suspect, we say, that there lurks under this wilful confusion of right with wrong any sinister desire of promoting, in the misery of the people, the wretched objects of that faction of which Mr. O'Connell calls himself the head. Of course, we say, this cannot be supposed or substantiated; but whether, after all, this really is so or not, the fact is certain that Mr. O'Connell, however, opposed, and justly opposed, to some particular details of the present Poor Law, yet makes use of and adopts, in order to defeat the deserving poor of their right to a public provision, its great and very pestilential, and very Whig principle, the principle, viz., that it is to be assumed as an axiom that poverty aNvm results from misfortune, and is therefore alwAys more or less a crime (at least politically speaking) and can not accordingly be entitled, upon any pretense,' or it any shape, to public support from the state. This was the doctrine with which tbe Whigs slew the old Poor Law; and Mr. O’Connell although decidedly anxious to gain all the popularity which may atccrue to the opposers of the workhouse system, is still very glad to wield the weapon of this sare modern poor law doctrine, in order therewith to overthrow the first aid fundamental principle of all poor law Whatsoever.,"" Many persons,"" he says, ""I give themselves great credit for tbeiy cheap humanity, by declaring themselves friendi to 'the principle of a Poor Law,' though they object lo the details of the system., ""1 I have never yet been able to obtain from any body a satisfactory explanation of what is meant by the; principle of a PoorLaw,' unless it be that which will aways be found to be practio,ly mischievious-namely, the suppoit by the state of the indigent, no matter how that indigence has been proiuced, whether by diseipation, drankenness, and extravagance, OR BY MERE MISFORTUNEL',The support, then, of the unfortunate-of persons who are left destitate by no fault of their own, but ""by xMRE misfortune,"" by risfortune and nothing else, is, we are told, ""practically mis"" chievous,"" and is the same thing as publicly maintaining the dissipated and drunken. So says hard-hearted and hard-fisted Whiggery, in the person of Mr. DANIEL O'CONNqELL. Bat Mr. UCornrNm proceeds,-,"" That is, in other words, an indiscrimi"" nate"" (how logical this inference, that every Poor Law must be es entially and necessarily indiscriminate!), ""an indiscriminate support of aU the indi"" gent, accompanied (as it MUST be)"" (how logical again!) ""with all the vexatious and most expensive ""machinery for the administration of such. relief,"" We are here told, then, two things, and ti4y are certainly somewhat startling ones. First, tfiat.no poor law can possibly be framed on the principle of wiving free relie' to those, and4 those only{, vho 4re really inwant, and unable to support themselves; snd, 5eoondly, that that free gift cannot be adminis tered, axcept indiscriminate7y, AND ALso through the, melium of ""expensive machinery."" These two propositions are not worth refuting; they are palpably mnd ridiculously absurd, as Mr. O'CoNNELt Must probably be aware. They assume, first, that, poliLically speaking, poverty is ALtAYs a crime, for, therwise, for the state to relieve it could not be zlways, and in every case, ""practicaUy mischievous;"" end, secondly, that it is impoonible to give state relief except through workhouses and commisjions, a proposition manifestly absurd. But as Mr. O'CoNNELL sneers at the ""cheap humanity"" s"" the principle of a Poor Law,"" and is yet unable to get a satisfactory explanation of that' principle,""-"" unklss"" the support of drunkenness end so forth be of the essence of that principle,we will condescend somewhat to enlighten him on the subject. He begins, then, by asserting the paramaount duty alid obligation of private almsgiving ;- and, so far, we most cordially concur with him. Private almsgiving is doubtless the first duty. But we would ask Mr. O'CoNNELL whether, in a country like ours-in a country where all the people are not and do not profess to be even Christians, much less members of the ONE universal church, and where even of those who nominally acknowledge the obligation of exercising that charity which that church inculcates, not one tenth, if so much, are really likely to practise it, in a country where it is consequently inmpossible to expect that there should be any general and systematic support derived to the poor from individual exertion,-in a country where ""individual charity,"" even though assisted by a system (though a miserable one) of public poor laws, yet allows fellow creatures and fellow Christians, and that not unfrequently, to perish, literally to DrE of want;-we would ask Mr. O'CONNELL, we say, whether, independently of the consideration that there is possibly such a thing as a national obligation to support the poor, distinct from the obligation to do so which is incumbent oae ilidividuals,-we would ask whether, on mere grounads of decency and decorurn, and admitting for the present that there is no public obligation to support the poor, -whether it .v-.;ld be right, or safe, or expedient, in a coux try such as this, to trust entirely to the fluctuating support of individual charity? Doubtless, in a perfect and exclusively Christian community the poor would be fully sup.. ported by the rich; and it would be wholly immaterial whether that support were voluntary or compulsory, individual or national; but in a state of things such as that with which we have to deal there is, over and above the duty incumbent upon us as a nation of supporting the poor, the undeniable fact that private almsgiving is insufficient, lamentably insufficient, and not to be depended upon. It follows, then, that the principle that the state must support, and freely, gratuitously support, all tkose who ttuly are unable to support themselves, S3 long as they are so unablethe principle, in short, of a Poor Law-must be admitted. And as Mlr. O'COZWNBLr is in doubt what that principle is, we will enunciate it for him again, It is this,-that every Christian Government iE bound, as a matter of police, as a matter of morality, and as a matter of religion, to supply, freely, ungrudgingly, and at the public expense,,witme ot workhouses or commissions, but at homes of tkfeir9 own, with all the necessazies of life, all those who from sickness or age, and poverty, are unable to maintain themselves; and to provide all those who could, if so provided, maintain themselves, but who, by no fault of their own, cannot without that provision do so, with the means, by giVing them work or otherwise, of supporting themselves. This principle we take not to be the principle of the New Poor Law. That law does not snake work or provision for the poor, but starves them into finding it; and for sickness or age it makes no allowance. We will close our observations upon Mr. O'C9rNi U. gy quoting the following passage,-the. trneut. wodo i,his letter, concereing the operation of this wo'rkhouse systemi, ""It does not relieve poverty until it amounts to actual destitution; and, even then, it gives no assistanice, scept in a place of confinenment, and to the exteat qf merely sstiaini?g exitence. Besides, it separates tih hfaand froxn the tow , and the moter fromn her children above tlc age of infancy. It tterly refuses to give relhf to aty part of a famiay, unless the entire submit to conflnement. It is quite ascertained, that scarcely any ablebodied maule sunits to obtain relief upon such terms. The consequence is, that the ablebodied male pauper, knowiing that as long ashe remains with his fanmily they wili not be received into the poorhouse, is tempted to break up all his natural ties and to quit the country. The son is tempted to desert his mother-the brother to desert his sister-the father to desert his family; who, in his absence, are receivable into the workhouse. It is aot, perhaps, easy to conjecture the extent of criminality to which the unhappy husband may be thus exposed; but that late cannot be a good one which creates and presses such temptation on sons, brothers, busbands. The boust of those who knew and loved the Irish character was the sanctity of their domestic affections. The Poor Law is calculated to extinguish this loving and loveable virtue."
