Ireland do at present for e miserable pittance earned on e public roads allow me en in e name of a faiful and suffering people to implore of you not only to stretch e present relief on an  scale into

many are prepared fore on a principle which amplifies as well to dispute the probable efficiency of the to our social a to our religious oblige half dozen Irish acts of this session. the  it is also more right. but we have simple fact of the case is that very few now before us the history of the rent indeed know that any acts have been distress if indeed there has been any passed at all. fearful

posirively and calamity of last season which events have gratuitously injurious character  proved to have been so exaggerated and resulted.   yet so real the ssubject of so much oversevere has been an absolute ste ii . is nobody fault but such is the fact. taking the whole commercial view of the transaction the cost of the Indian corn and oatmeal has been considerably above the market pri. the question of its being sold or given ay or sold at what is popularly called  the cost pri has nothing to do with this view. vv are speaking of the total cost to the ration. the 98810 quarters of Indian corn and oatmeal have  including all the outgoings that could be included in the estimate such as freight grinding and other expenses as much as  but this of course has not been all the expenses. iris added significantly the pay of the commissariat offirs of the ordnan and militaristic employed under the board of works and the expenses of the admiralty steamers for the conveyan of the meal are provided for in the estimates of their respecrive departments and are not included in this statement. now this of course is in itself a very trifling affair. when the question is a famine this country can afford to throw ay hundreds of thousands. but it is as well to observe that the BrIrish government unavoidably makes a bad merchant. that is not its calling even taking into account what is given to the charity account in this transaction looking only to the cost of the foodie is a losing and steful affair and the private speculator who did no better would soon be bankrupt. we repeat it is no ones fault. no power no sagacity no care on earth could undertake at on an entirely new mercantile transaction out of its sphere with new persons and in new plas without considerable loss. the whole experiment  out of the regular streams of traffic. thoroughly approving the step as we do we yet may point it out as a rning that government cannot continue it or fall into that style of policy. it is not its offi to supply food and it cannot do so without ste. there have been other effects more serious and virtually more steful than this direct. and demonstrable ste. the pris both of food and of labor have been injuriously though inevitably interfered with. that tendency to proud  in exss to accumulate and to reserve which is the very first and most ne 0 instinct of trade without which there could be no wealth no power no prosperity no pea no improvement no society at all has been discouraged. dealers have been  from the market perhaps not alys to return their useful craft has been baffled their lawful store depreciated. so much have they felt this  heavy blow and great discouragement that at this moment we hear they are besieging the Irish secretary with ques whether the relief measures of the past season are to be renewed next winter. should such be the intention they will take a common sends view of the fact and not invest their money in food. the natural and spontaneous purveyors for the people are t disabled and destroyed. he usual storehouses on which the chief relian must be laid will be t found empty. a gigantic interloper in the shape of the public benevolen has

offering themselves for harvest or raily work tan were  known. the story among the Irish immigrants themselves is that their friends are staying at home in the hope of employment in their own neighborhood from the rent and forthcoming grants. whether their employment on such works as are likely to be selected by kcal relief committees is likely to be so profitable as the employment from which they are rndud we leave our readers to decide. are these results sufficient reasons against such measures of instant relief as were adopted in the winter 1 rtainly not. nessity kno neither law

the public works bill. debate in par limiest Tuesday august 18 1846.  house of commons wettest into committer on the public works Ireland bill. in the committee lord j. Russell referred to what had been done in the course of fast year and in the spr of this year by the fate gogovernment on the failure of the potato crop in Ireland. hav shown that in the purchase of Indian corn in donations in aid of subscriptions in public works in general presentments and in various smaller items the gogovernment had expended for the relief of the people of Ireland  of which  was dither repaid or to be repairer proceeded to examine in detail the amount of the evil which this money was expended to remedy and to describe to the house the benefit which was derived from that expenditure. he expressed his sorrow at be obliged to state that although there whereat present in the greater pt of the counties of  harvest work and wages sufficient for the support of the  population the prospect of the potato crop was this year even more distress than it was dur the last. hav corroborated this statement by private letters from lord Shannon Enniskillen lord Bernard colonel  shorthand other individuals in various districts of Ireland he proceeded to explain to the house the measures which he intended to propose for its adoption in order to make provision for some employment for the labor people of Ireland. he proposed to introduce a bill to this effect that the  should have power on recommendation made to him to summon a barony sessions or a county sessions for works for relief of the poor  when those sessions should have assembled they would be empowered anti required to order such public works as might be necessary for the employment and relief of the people. the choice of the works would be left to them and they would be put into execution by the officers of the board of works. advances would be made from the treasury for the purposes of those works to be repaid in 10 years at  per cent. interest the lowest rate ever taken for works of this kind. hav described the manner in which he in tended to provide for the repayment of these advances he next informed the committee how he intended to provide for the case of poor districts where it would be impossible for the money to be repaid. he proposed to grant  for the purposes of those districts where works of public utility would be undertaken by the gogovernment on its responsibility. he also proposed that commissariat officers should be stationed in different parts of Ireland who should from time to time communicate with sir r. rout on the state of distress in the several districts. as evil had arisen from interference by the gogovernment with the supply of public food ho did not propose to interfere with the regular mode by which Indian corn and other kinds of grain might be brought into the country. there might however be particular cases where it might be necessary to employ the commissariat officers. he also added that all the officers of the commissariat and of the board of works would be paid by go government for the services they performed. hav these objects in view he proposed first that a sum should be voted to defray the expanses already incurred  then a vote for direct advances by exchequer bills for the purposes stated in the bill  then the vote for the districts which might speedily require it. he considered the present as. a special case requir the intervention of parliament and render it imperative on the gogovernment to take extraordinary measures for the relief of the people he trusted that the course which he was propos would convince the poorest among the Irish people that the house wasn't insensible to the claims which they had upon it as the parliament of the united kdom. he concluded by assur the committee that the late ministry had shown a very laudable anxiety to meet this evil that the remedies which they applied had been suited to the occasionalism the present gogovernment was imitat the spirit in which they had acted and was endeavor  to take advantage of their experience to correct errors which were inevitable in consequence of unforeseen difficulties.,THE PUBLIC WORKS BILL,4,8/18/1846
a poor law necessary for Ireland leading article Wednesday august 19 1846. it is no great praise to the minister to say t his measures for the relief of Irush distress are a decided improvement on those of his predecessor. so much is due to the interval brief  is between the respective dates of the two sets of measures. the few months t have elapsed have removed t political incredulity which refused to admit the seriousness of the disaster and boasted itself insensible to sufferings of which the sons of wealth were never likely to have any personal experience these few months have also given too probable an earnest of a long or at least an indefinite period of straitness and privation. more n all they have exhibited the working of temporary measures. a practical nation like ours will not go on long temporizing with evils. measures of coercion indeed we have been glad to make temporary enough. no terms could be too short for enactments t presented so flagrant a violation to our own notions of constitutional usage and law. but the British legislature will not go on for years feeding and employing the poor of Ireland on a mere extempore system for the simple reason t food and employment are not like flogging fines and imprisonment merely occasional necessities. every month is now adding tithe argument for some better plan for employing and maintaining the Irush poor   common sense points out t this plan must be permanent as also . t it should not be simply an annual grant from the public exchequer. really then we do not see how lord john Russell could escape the contusion to which he has biome the district is to employ and feed its own poor. t simple formula fulfills three conditions of the question the poor must be employed and fed. 2. t is a uniform necessity. 3. the public exchequer cannot undertake the cost nor the government the sole administration of relief. no prejudice no ingenuity can avoid the only solution of this  accept the premises and you have implicitly consented to a regular system of outdoor employment and relief. we can imagine statesmen willing to go to any extremity rather n acknowledge this  to go on annually subsidizing the poor of freehandedly wiling perhaps to see them annually decimated by fame and pestilence rather n adopt a provision which happens to be part of the wisdom of our ancestors. but unless a minister be pledged up to his neck against the old practice of British benevolence we may now safely appeal to his candor the occasion has come Ireland must have an effectual system of poor laws. as the necessity is urgent as well as for other reasons government in the first instance advances the money.  while there ought to be public works an d those public works ought to be undertaken under due control the cost of these works will not be defrayed by means of grants but by loans to be defrayed by the baronies and the counties in the districts for which they were granted in those last words consist the virtue and vitality of the measure. the district in which are the persons employed and for the benefit of which the work is to be done will itself defray the expense. the machinery is the next question. the proposed bill will give power to the lord lieutenant on due recommendation to summon a barony sessions or a county sessions for works for relief of the poor. when these sessions shall have  assembled the premier proceeds to explain  they will be empowered and required to order such public works as shall be necessary for the employment of the people and for their relief  i say empowered and required continues the premier because it is intended t it shall be incumbent on them on being summoned to order those works. here is distinctly recognized the local duty of finding employment for the poor. under existing circumstances the locality most suitable for the apportionment of this duty is the barony of the count itself. hat is a matter of great in difference.  public works of course are great roads canals drains enclosures navigation and such undertakings of general and extensive utility. for them of course a large district ought to be assessed. the choice of the works will be a matter of arrangement between government and the local sessions. the latter will be invited to suggest and recommend and government t is the board of work swill approve. as the public advances the money and the improvement effected by its outlay will be the chief security for its repayment it will be proper to provide against an impendent unremunerative expenditure. it is necessary also to protect the interest of the ratepayer in a county where jobbing is rather a custom n a sin. the board of works is already in possession of the ground. it has an immense stock of local information and projects on its shelves enough to remodel the emerald isle to almost any conceivable fashion. the difficulty is to select and to executes difficulty which will not be met by surrendering everything to a local scramble. the board of works has also the requisite stiff to its officers therefore the execution of the public works will be committed. for our own part so lit are we tied to any prejudice in favor of purely agricultural employment t we do not see why these sessions should not negotiate the employment of the poor on railroads in progress. the fact of their legislative sanction presumes their utility  and it is also very evidently the policy and the duty of the government not to aggravate the serious difficulties of those gigantic undertakings by holding out to lour any strong counter attraction. it is proposed t the money be advanced at 31 per cent. interest much less n what Irush railroad companies and any other Irush borrowers whatever are now in the habit of paying. the loans are to be repaid in 10 years  and the levies for t purpose are not to be according to the assessment for the county rate but according to the assessment for the poor rate. a proportion of the expense therefore will fall upon the owners and the poorer occupiers will be in a great measure relieved. these provisions we think will be found to meet the superficial not to say flippant objections we have recently heard made to an efficient Irush poor law viz t it would swallow up the whole profits of the land and t there is not capital enough for the purpose.  capital will be provided  and if the works are selected with tolerable judgment and executed with moderate economy we cannot doubt t the capital will be reproduced and will remain on the land after it has been refunded to the exchequer. but it is ridiculous to say there is no capital where there are labor and land.  there is capital in Ireland sufficient for a liberal poor law is evident from its exporting a greater quantity of food n any other equal county in the world t at least is an undeniable proof of its actual wealth. a country which exports the mesne of supporting millions can of course  for its own improvement. in principle it must be observed this measure is no innovation in Ireland t county has all along had a system for the employment of labor. it existed however in a peculiarly rush form as if meant to be abused. the grand juries feared neither god nor man  they were amenable neither to government nor the ratepayer  so they jobbed away labor and money with the same utter in differ engr to justice and public utility as the agrarian lawgivers living around them showed in jobbing away human life. there will be ample security all the security t the empire can bestow against such  serration in carrying out the forthcoming measure. the board of vodka will be responsible to the imperial parliament for the wisdom of its sanction as also for its economical execution of  public works  and the legislature will then be to blame if the board of works is not kept  its duty.,A POOR LAW NECESSARY FOR IRELAND,2,8/19/1846

it is exceedingly generous and deserves more anks an it is likely to obtain. we must however protest against e system of working e  wling horse. it wl never do for e Irish poor to depend on British industry for employment. is at so extravagant an apprehension at ere is no prospect of it ever being fulfled  on e contrary ings tend very much is way. it is becoming an everyday occurrence to charge British industry wi e duties of Irish property. e imper exchequer has just virtually made a grant of no less a sum an  and out to e Irish landowner. we are indebted to lord montage for his forcible way of putting e sacrifice. Irish property up to is day has condescended to pay somewhat more an a ird of e expenses of e Irishconstabulary force a sort of expense which it is unnecessary to say english counties and english towns pay for emselves wiput trouping outlier neighbors for a faring. at ird amounted to  year equivalent to a capital of  we now discharge e Irish landowner of at obligation. we present him wi e money. hencefor whe e english and scotch wholly maintain eir own county and municipal police e enormous and expensive police force of Ireland is wholly saddled on e imper exchequer. is is one instance of a tendency to burden British industry wi Irish obligations. oer instances wl be fresh to e memory and famiar to e knowledge of e reader. is year we have already advanced more an  of  is motto be repaid. nor wl it be forgotten at Ireland pays no assessed taxes no land tax no income tax and is favored even in e excise. ere is a manifest tendency in ese ings. it is a growing ev. e moment lord Devons monster report made its appearance we immediately said at its animas was e relief of e landlord  and at if anying would come of its recommendations it would be e very measure we have just alluded toe rowing on e state e remaining ird of e police. e landowner wi infallible aim and relentless grasp has secured his interest in lord Devons suggestions. so we go on. e peasant is starving and we subsidize e landowner. rents rise and e peasant starves more an ever. we ball be told perhaps just now it is raer ungracious to be making ese exceptions but unless we do ings just  skunks we point out e true nature and bearing of enactments just when ey are passing we should despair of procuring. attention to e subject. we ink at British benevolence has been considerably imposed upon not so much by e Irish peasant whose distress is genuine enough but by e Irish landowner. he makes e same use of his peasantry as e tipsy does of her stolen chd. she pinches e poor creature and extorts our anis on e streng of its sufferings. one could almost imagine at some crafty beldam of  landowner was pinching john archbishop of  when he howls so much to e landowners tune.,ENGLISH PROPERTY TAXED FOR IRISH DISTRESS,2,8/27/1846

state of things as if there were no help for its if name had fixed her irreversible decree that once at least in every four or five years Ireland shoud be laid waste by famine. to judge from the almost periodical recurrence of these visitations and from the hone in which people speak of  one wold imagine that Ireland was some barren rock or thirsty wilderness in an inhospitable region of the globe to which nature had denied all the  qualities of soil and climate and which  had filled with an exuberance of population without affording them the means or even the possibility of subsistence. one woud imagine that this miserable people had neither hands to labor with tools to till the earth with nor grain to sow it with. such is really the aspect in which we of this country seem to regard the inhabitants of the sister island during the period of one of their usual famines. our sentiments towards them are simply  of pity. oh  how shocking we exclaim that those poor Irish shoud have lost their potatoes again  where shall we find something to feed them with  we do not think of inquiring whether or no the dependence of a whole nation upon so precarious an article of food be a necessary or an unnecessary evil and if unnecessary whether it ought not to be in every way denounced and discouraged. we do not think of inquiring with bishop Berkeley whose fault is it if poor Ireland still continues poor 1 now the best friend to the Irish. oud be he who coud effectually persuade them that the fault lay entirely with themselves they inhabit a country a great part  which is at least equal in fertility to our own with more that is capable of being made so. there is no reason except their own wilful mismanagement why they shoud not grow as. fine crops of wheat as are raised in the Lothians and after feeding themselves export the surplus to our  after years of present suffering and  expectation they idly and stupidly persist in staking their very existence upon  a crop the precarious nature of which is no more than a fair set off against the small amount of labor required to produce it. without entering into tho question how far the laws and customs relating to landed property in Ireland how far the landlords themselves are responsible for this evil i may safely assert that the prejudices and ignorance other Irish people are at least as inveterate and as fatal as their misgovernment and the ill example of their superiors have been culpable and injurious. every Irishman must needs be a farmer aud work as much or as little as he pleases  the idea of being a laborerand engaging in regular employment is revolting  him the great object of his life is to rent a miserable patch of land to build himself a hovel or burrow in the north to marry and if possible to live as well as his pig. the word  improvement  is not in his vocabulary  he is content to live as his forefathers have done. with such exalted views in his mind the first question is how to realize them  and to this the potato furnishes a speedy though treacherous reply. no other article of food promises so much at so small a cost. an acre of potatoes will maintain four times as many people as an acre of wheat while the time and labor of cultivating it are comparatively trifling. here then are abundant means of gratifying his love of idleness and what he calls independence. and so long as nature bestows the years of plenty trim her revolving cycle and withholds the years of famine things go on smoothly. for a month or two our farmer is busied with hinting his potatoes  for another month or two he leaves. his home and comes to reap where hr sowed not in the smiling harvests of England  while for tho remaining two thirds of the year ho does nothing but sleep drink or beg. but nature will not suffer her laws to be broken with impunity she leas made daily labor the condition of daily food  and those who will not submit to her decrees must be content to pay. the penalty. thus famine is the certain recompense of a cheap and idle subsistence and while the latter in addition to its other evils tends to multiply population to an unhealthy extent and to perpetuate their miseries the former stands ready with scourge in hand to expel the noxious brood or to lash them into industry and prudence. nothing is more certain than this that the dense population of Ireland and. its squalid condition are principally owing to the potato.  had it not been says   for the almost uni venal dependence of the Irish people on the potatoes the principal part of their subsistence coupled with the facility with which thebaine huts ana slips of land it is quite impossible that population coud have advanced so rapidly as it his done  the last fifty years the same writer  as potatoes are used only  subsidiary species of food their introduction serves to improve the condition of the laborer and they frequently afford him an additional means of support in years when there is a failure of the corn crops but those who are habitually and entirely felon potatoes are placed upon the extreme verge of human subsistence. . when deprived of their accustomed food they are unable from the smallness of their wages to purchase what is dearer  and there is potato famine in Ireland were to continue nothing cheaper to which they can resort. five years longer it woud prove a greater to a people placed under such unfortunate blessing to the country than any that has circumstances scarcity and famine must ever been devised by parliamentary combe synonymous. taking these facts into

the government scheme for relies lading article Wednesday September 2 1846. the accounts we continue daily to receive from all parts of Ireland leave no room to doubt the failure of the potato crop. from the giants causeway to ce clear from lerick to Dublin not a green field is to be seen. the disease having attacked the plant at a much earlier period this year than it did in 1845 the root has been arrested in its growth and prevented from arriving at maturity. thus what was last year but partial destruction is now a total annihilation and it has become a very general lief that the month of. December will not. find single potato in the country. eland is therefore doomed to suffer a incurrence if it should not rather be called a continuance of tit distress which has well nigh pauperized the whole population. taught by fatal errors of policy to look to the state for assistance Ireland stands now in an attitude of confident expectation waiting for the public supplies which hitherto  not been denied her. should they be denied in future there will be much bitterness and great complaint it is an inevitable consequences inevitable by governments as individuals benefits once conferred if they be not continued are seedily forgotten and m place of gratitude breed but discontent. it is a law or a vice of human nature and we are not to look for an exception among the Irish people. if any abatement is made in the  of reliesf afforded from the public funds or y change in its plication which savors at all of retrenchment the government will meet with more abuse than thanks. the people expect to be fed and one way or another they. must be fed. the precedent once established be followed and there is an end of argument. if with the experience of the present we could recall the past and place ourselves again in the autumn of 1845 there are few if any of the measures then adopted on behalf of Ireland which would now be proved. we write in no spirit of hostility to that country  but on the contrary with the most earnest desire to recommend what is most conducive to her lasting interest. she has suffered too much already from temporary measures from the plication of superficial remedies which alleviating only the symptoms have aggravated her disease. we desire to lee an end of this patchwork policy if policy that may be called which is nothing but a series of makeshifts. there is a kind of . spendthrift generosity that benefits neither the giver nor the reviver and of this complexion have been the lm bestowed by great Britain upon her sister island. the state has still some millions of Irishmen to support who in spite of all that has been done for them are rather worse than better for its charity. and why i because the charity has been bestowed without judgment and . accepted without gratitude. neither the chcter nor the condition of the people has been  proved by the transaction.  the measures proposed by the present ministry contain several marks of provement and the germ at least of a more farsighted policy.. we pubis in another column a minute of the lords of the treasury intended for the guidance of the various officials in Ireland which shows that the details of their 1 lief system have not been adopted without mature considerations one principal error of its predecessors the Russell cabinet is determined to avoid. the state will not meddle a second te with the provision market nor blindly enter into a competition with private trade at once suicidal of itself and destructive of its rivals. indeed with the experience of the past and present year still fresh in the recollection it would have been little short of madness to repeat the experent of feeding the Irish people from government stores. the change how university ever is not without exception. in some districts too poor to command a market and  difficult of access to repay the merchant for instance on the coast of Connem or the most wretched parts of clear and  will still be supplied from government stores not to underbid the private trader to supply his place. the exception does not seem injudicious  for as the only objection to the former plan was that it interfered with the ordtry market where there is no market to interfere with the objection fails. another great provement is in the urn of government works which will be more sparingly plied and with greater discrination. employment on reliesf works also is to be afforded to those only olio cannot obtain it elsewhere and to them  lower than the average rate of wages. the necessity of this restriction will be understood by those who have real the correspondence between the government and its commissioners. major surmounts in a letter dated the 4th of august writes thus from lerick   nothing can be finer than the corn crops now being cut but lowly i am told for. want of laborers resulting it is to be feared from the injudicious continuance of public works as well as in the mismanagement of some committees in not gradually withdrawing reliesf from persons able to work. it is notorious also that fewer Irish laborers have offered themselves for the english harvest this summer than in any previous year. these facts are but too significant and their purport has been duly preciated. there is still however in the new measures some of the old leaven left. the changes although in the right direction are still chiefly of detail  the principle is preserved which governed the late administration. that principle we find it possible to prove. we cannot by any process of reasoning be convinced that the general body of the nation ought to be taxed for the support of particular districts in Ireland. the theory and practice of the constitution are alike averse from such a proceeding. nor do we feel ourselves in the slightest degree nearer conviction when we reflect upon the consequences which flow from the  plication of the principle. we ask in the first place who are the persons chiefly benefited by it  they the peasantry the poor the mass of the population 1 by no means  for to these it is indifferent whence the money comes so long as it is not taken from themselves. for whose sake then is it it can be for none other than the landlords. these suffering gen Tlemcen sinking under burdens which never until now were heard of groaning under a pressure of taxation which never until now was felt ask and unhpily for their country obtain a reliesf in com prison of which the subsidies afforded to the peasant are but dust in the balance. perhs it wail be said on behalf of the government that we have misrepresented its intentions which are not to throw the burden of Irish poverty upon the national funds. it is true in theory that the sums to be mediately spent iii Ireland are to be returned at a remote period and by numerous installments the mikes con strutted by their aid being the security  for repayment. this is true we say in  theory that sit is true so long as practice  does not make it false  but we peal to any partial person in the least acquainted with Irish affairs whether there is the slightest probability of the money being in fact repaid. for ourselves looking at the state of the country and . the inveterate habit of jobbing which prevails among all classes we are forced to the conclusion that the so called loans will in the end prove gifts. we there fore call them by their true names. on the whole however it must be coll fessed that her majesty ministers have made the best of the Irish difficulty. like the steward in the pble lord john Russell has done wisely at least for hself and his owl credit. his measures there is every reason to believe will in sure a sufficient supply of food during the coming winter. thus Ireland paid by the state and where needful fed from her stores cannot for very shame continue to assert that  en glands danger is Irelands opportunity.,THE GOVERNMENT SCHEME FOR

rent war has commenced in t district the ultima object of which the wrir seems to think is the overthrow of the landlord as the prelude to the establishment of fixity of nure. h says  in diverse parts of this district since  has. been cut some landlords atndants have thought it prudent to make in certain instance a distass on the crops of default mg nants. previous to the respective sa days appoind writn notices have been posd in each place of public resort for some mis around the vicinity of the place at. which the sa was advertised to take place those notices being to inform the public t they are expecd to atnd to prevent a sa taking place. the consequence. has  rhet within the last week large multitudes have been assembd at the several places appoind and have sue cess fully in these instances prevend any sa taking place. in one instance which occurred yesrday prepara were made for the atndance of a large military and police force at the scene of an mended sa for the purpose of procting the party authorized  sell f but their presence was dispensed with owing to t party deeming it usess to prosecu the affair as no one would venture to bid for the effects exposed for sa. the friends of disorder however assembd and i make no doubt t had the sa taken place blood would ave been shed. to exhibit the characr of the warfare t has thus begun i may mention t in the case to whf oh i avo just alluded the nant owed but  being one years rent of a nice farm. and i am credibly informed t the wheat crop alone on it is value for   then was amp provision for the rent with a. large overplus besides which were an oat and a turn crop. for such a nant no sympathy  the score of want of food could exist  and therefore the organized opposition to the payment of rent is fully manifesd. t such a sta of things must be met by prompt and dermined measures on the part of the government and landed proprietors no one should for a moment gainsay if not anarchy and confusion will overcome law and order not inly will ruin be brought on many individuals but the entire rights of property ill become subverd. taking into consideration the severe loss of food t has  unsustained by the peop it will become landlords to exercise the utmost ent of niency toward their nants who have been sufferance who is it t has not been but of course in different degrees proportional to the nt of their other means. in the meantime the landlords naturally alarmed at the present discouraging aspect of affairs are bestirring themselves and several influential gentness have already come forward with plans and sugges for the consideration of the executive  the majority of which although more or ss objectionab in the details nd to show t the public mind is at ngth thoroughly awakened to the danger and t a crisis misapprehending tat will consumma the work tardily commenced by the institution of lord Devons land commission.  appears in print this evening a tr addressed to lord boroughs by  Horace  of  a magistra and deputy lieunant of the county of Carlow in the course of which referring to the recent landlord meeting held in limerick under the auspices of the earl of Devon he observes    mon sells proposal  to compel 0 landlord to provide productive employment for the poor upon his esta  i believe in many cases qui impracticab. many landlords have had their estas handed down to them with a dense and wretched population and moreover heavily charged with mortgages and other encumbrances this year  difficulty will be fund in colcting the rents  and if with diminished  they are still to be more heavily tagged  their present efforts to employ the poor on productive la lour will be paralyze still god forbid i should assert t jr this present year we ought riot to be provided  some such mporary measure as now proposed to mitiga the impending calamity  but with reference to future seasons i do assert t to pursue year afr year the same course would soon eat up all the resources of the country. i entirely agree with  mon sell t the general employment of the peop on productive labor cm oinly be accomplished by the direct agency of the landlords  but they can oinly be enabd to perform this duty by some such plan as is contained in the following sugges being adopd by government in the ensuing session of parliament t them carry out to a greaser ent the princ already acd upon in the drainage act and board of public works act. t them nd to all landed proprietors who possess encumbered estas money at  per cent. to pay off their existing mortgages taking from them a first charge on their property at 5 per cent. and binding them clown to lay out the difference of inrest between  and 5 or 6 per cent. annually on their estas in permanent improvements. these improvements to be carried out by the landlords themselves and their nants under the immedia supervision and control of the board of  assisd by an additional staff of officers. the fund by which they would be carried on would thus be cread out of the difference  a low and a higher ra of inrest and t without risk or loss to either party. the landlord would probably have no objection to having  sta for a creditor. insad of an individual  and the paying off of so many mortgages would have the effect of unlocking so much mo e capital fr investment in land and its improvement. by this plan one of the great obj cc  to abseneism would  done away with. in many cases now a large rental is swept yearly out of the country and litt or no return given. but in every instance where such absene landlord owed. money and chose to avail himself of this act a portion at ast of his rental would be returned and invests in lasting improvements to this measure no objection of a party nature could be made. all persons circumstanced as i have described would i am sure gladly avail themselves of it  and tho landlords who now possess their incomes car but hitherto have not been inclined to expend money in improving their estas would for very shame be forced inwards in amicllb rivalsh with their neighbors employment becoming more general the wage of labor would of necessity rise and the laboring class would be enabd to procure a more substantial daft and to withstand with courage the failure of  potato crop. a higher sysm of agriculture would be introduced based on all the modern discoveries and aided by science and the spirit of inquiry now abroad  and i feel sure t the small cottier nant would not be ft behind in the general progress cf society around him if by betr farming he could be enabd to pay his rent punctually and such members of his family as were not needed on his allotment would probably find pnty of work as laborers the great mptation to his eviction would cease and thus the chief and primary cause of all agrarian outrage would be checked. whenever in the opinion of the overseer of the board of works an esta had been improved to the utrmost i would suggest t the sum previously expended upon it every year should be applied as a sinking fund to pay off the princal of the charge held by government  we might thus look to the next generation coming into possession of their estas

Ireland and the highlands are now in the very same case and the empire is at its wits end for a remedy. anat then is the difference 1  is that so terrible in Ireland which in England does not create perplexity and hardly moves compassion y we ask this question because it appears to us of the very first importance to all classes or Irish society to impress on them that there is nothing really so peculiar so exceptional in the condition which they look upon as the pit of utter despair. it is an object to impress on all that they must do as we do here  they must be gradually assimilated to our state. they must adopt our methods. and agitate if agitate they will for a perfect community in our laws as far as those laws appear to be the source of our greater prosperity. the letters and extracts groin the Irish press which we have lately given to our carders show how deeply the delusion of some great legislative panacea has taken possession of the Irish mind. he state  the state is to do everything  laborer asks the state for national employment and national food  the landlord with equal importunity demands a national loan. does the state attempt this in England  but can the state anywhere make either employment or food or money 1 it cannot. it is true it may make the attempt but it is certain to fail. it can only succeed in exercising a slight regulating power of these things when it is so fortunate as to find them ready to its hands. the landlords ask for a loan. they put their demand in this specious and moderate form  we are burdene with mortgages say they at 5 or even 6 per cent. lend us money at  per cent. and pass a law that what is gained on the change of lenders shall be spent in the employment of the people and improvement of the land. alas for the perverse ingenuity for the hardihood of promise and confidence of expectation for which needy men in all ages have been so remarkable  how can the nation lend this money  he  required would be no trifle. the rental of Ireland is estimated it appears at thirteen millions. suppose it mortgaged to not quite half its amount and then you have an aggregate debt of one hundred millions paying an interest of five millions. where is the state to get these hundred millions 1 or half or a quarter  to exchange only a quarter of the Irish mortgages for government loans would not be thought much relief but that would cost twenty five millions. .he state is itself the greatest debt in the world.. t already owes nearly  hundred mil hons  so  is only one debtor asking another who is unfortunately still deeper in the mire to help him out of his difficulties. we question whether the state could borrow even as much as five millions for this purpose without injurious consequences very near akin to those experienced by the owner of the goose that laid golden eggs as soon as he attempted to  realize  the useful bird.  would in effect be a creation of stock to that amount and would throw down he market price of all securities and raise the rate of interest t an extent which in the pnt feverish state of things it is by 110 means agreeable to contemplate it is not impossible that Government might find that borrowing five millions at 3 per cent. was after all no such easy affair. chat becomes then of the unfortunate moneylenders themselves 7 the Irish landlord may possibly think it a waste of sympathy to care for that usurious race. he would not shed many tears if mortgages and mortgagees were molded to take their several parts in one splendid  but he must remember that there are times when the sight of a c vitalist is not quite so unpleasing  and with a view to contingencies it is desirable not entirely to extirpate the race. so gigantic a competitor as the state offering money at 3 would not leave many of the breed on Irish soil. there is no chance whatever of the scheme being attempted so it may perhaps seem unnecessary to sift it. we are merely offering reasons to a class which is apt to fabricate a grievance out of a simple negative however just and necessary it may happen to be. the state once for all ct mot lend the money. t cannot borrow the money without 111 consequences. it cannot undertake the invidious the impossible selection of objects for its bounty. what landowners what railways what navigation what public works what private speculations are to be singled out 1 all will ask. all have need. all are bur. dene with debts at 4 or 5 per cent. before many months perhaps even better interest will have been offered. ls it likely that the ninety nine who are disappointed will silently endure the better fortune of the hundredth who is blessed with a friend at court an  per cent. i,IRISH DEPENDENCE ON STATE AID,2,9/8/1846
the food crisis suggestions for relief. Friday September 11 1846. from the times correspondent. . Dublin sept. 9. the present crisis and the measures taken by gornment to meet the emergency ha called forth the following memorial from a ry influential meeting of the bended proprietary of the county of meathead under the auspices of the  of head fort   to his excellency john William earl of bees borough lord lieutenant gene  and gene gornor of Ireland  we the cent belief committee of the baronies of upper and lower quells and fore having already in our se local committees reported to your excellency our operations arising from the failure of last years potato crop are now desirous of submitting our unanimous opinion respecting the nature of the measures required to meet a yet more extensi calamity. we ha in the first place to express our conviction that the case which we are now called on to meet differs not only in degree but also hr the nature of the evil from that which we had to contemplate last season. last year when it appeared that a considerable portion of the food of the people had. perished we confidently anticipated that at the return of harst the people would be restored to the enjoyment of their usual supply. we had therefore to provide for a present but temporary deficiency  and our exertions for the relief of the people were adapted to such an emergency. we did not then at all contemplate a remedy by producing out of the groud a substitute for that which had perished  the temporary necessity would ha passed away before such a remedy could ha come into operation. all that was possible in that present distress was to accomplish a fair and economical distribution of the food which remained supplying the actual deficiency by the purchase of foreign corn. to effect this it was only required that the laboring population who had lost their food should be furnished with more than ordinary resources in  the readiest and the most available means of affording such wage was foud in the making and leling of roads and other works of the like description  and such works were therefore genely adopted. these works we concei to ha been suited to the emergency and highly useful for their temporary impose but we feel called on to express our conviction that the present deficiency is not temporary but peranent. none. of us now entertain the expectation that next years potato crop will put an end to ut difficulties by supplying food for the people. we ha no longer a temporary deficiency to meet  and we cannot re on e expedients which were  adopted to meet a pressing and as it  hoped a passing emergency. we  satisfied that a continued reliance on  expedients so far from affording per anent relief must inevitably aggravate the evils with which we are now threatens and pee highly injurious to the true  of all class for the question is not now of the distribution but of the production of food. we ha not now to relie a temporary distress but to make provision for the food of a people. we cannot hope for tube peranent supply of the deficiency of our home produce from the introduction of foreign corn to be paid for by a tax on the land which has ceased to be producti.  cannot now look on any remedy as adequate or safe which does not sim at producing out of the groud a supply  food equal in quantity and if possible superior in quality to that which the oud has heretofore produced. we are of opinion that such a remedy is to be foud only in the employment of additional capital and hour on the land. it is to the united exertions of the landowner the farmer and the laborer that we must look for a substitute for the food which has perished. to stimulate their energies and to direct the application of the capital the skill and the jab our of these se classes to the increased cultivation of the land afford the only means of escaping from the evils with which we are threatened. any measures which tend to dirt tother objects the spital and labor which ought to be so employed must to a corresponding extent withdraw it from that channel in which alone it can be really useful. to anticipate the available resources of the country and to compel or induce tie outlay of them on public works not p.roducti of food or of any commodity which could be exchanged for food must fearfully aggravate the dangers of our position. such we are persuaded must be the ultimate result if the relief of distress  ensuing year is to be effected by a continuance of the system of public works. under that system two classes who ha heavily suffered in their incombustible landowner and the  the relief of the national distress which results from their peculiar misfortune. their already lessened funds are taken away from them at a time when tile increased application of capital to the gioud is most essential to the national et  and e funds are employed in withdrawing the strength of the laborer from the production of food to expend it in a forced and unnatu extent upon works which when completed would lea him in a state of starvation as before. but this system of relief tends further to discourage and payze the exertions of landowner mid farmer still more than it disables them. if the man who is willing to employ additional labor on his own land is also to be taxed for the support of e laborers whom his neighour will not employ he will be orburdened and will be drin to relie himself. this he cannot do but by restricting his voluntary expenditure and throwing his laborers as well as his neighours upon the common fund as the only means of equalizing their burdens. many who ha employed additional labor already feel that they will be constrained to adopt this course in  if last years system of relief be persisted in. on these grouds while we are prepared cheerfully to undertake whate'er burdens are necessary for the relief of present distress and to make ery exertion which may be required to provide for the future support of the people  and while we are willing and resoled at all hazards to provide by public works the promptest relief for immediate  urgent necessity we feel it our duty to deprecate the continuance of a system which tends to discourage the exertions of landlord and farmer and to misapply the labor of the people. and we earnestly recommend as the principle of future relief the adoption of the maxim  that the labor for which the land is compelled to pay should be applied in deloping the producti powers of the land. private justice and public policy alike call for its adoption for the preservation of the people under the heavy calamity which it has pleased god to bring upon us. believing that in free discussion will be foud the best means of applying a principle so essential to the national welfare we shall direct the attention of our baronies to the subject and we respectfully recommended it to your excellency consideration.,THE FOOD CRISIS-SUGGESTIONS FOR RE:LIEF,1,9/11/1846

Irish landlords and the distress. leading article Friday September 18  the  of the potato in the social economy of Ireland has yet to be ascertained there prevails a good deal of error on  point. the potato is treated by many as the natural food of t people. use of corse is second nature. the Irishman it is said requires a soft mouthful and a large bellyful of food. bread is too hard for his mouth and too compact for t other less dignified organ which plays so important a part in the physical and political constitu of man. his view of things applies with equal force to the tribes t depend on the precarious arrival of fish to their shores or seals fa their icebergs or who dispense with the encumbrance of clothes.  kind nature perforce adapts herself to almost any priva. this is all t can be said of a dependence on potatoes but we entertain no doubt whatever t the hungriest and most squalid bogtrotter in Connaught whatever his present condi if it should be considered an object could with judicious treatment be brought to bear a dinner of turtle soup roast beef pheasant and ice punch very dlvy of his life without  very much the worse for the change. so thoroughly are we the creatures of  and so easily adapted to the most disagreeable change. the potato therefore has no more claim to reconsidered the Irishmans naal foil n t very wholesome and palatable dish which  called in this country an Irish stew or any other produc of which Ireland is proved to be capable. iriris not in the physique of the peasant but m the moral and commercial system of the landowner t we must look for the natural habitat of this root. it is one of the means by which the landlord exacts a rent wholly out of propor not indeed to the natural wealth of the soil but to the capital invested upon it. in a country without capital and without t security for life and for property which capital requires the comforts and decides of life pull against rent. could the Irish live on the tops of their potatoes type could then give the roots to their landlords. could they go abroad without clothes each family would pay perhaps ten schillings more n it does such g possibly the annual outlay in t fashionable luxury. the commercial principle of this view is familiar to every householder no person of ordinary prudence wilel keep a hunter to do the work of a nag a horse to do the work of an ass or a man to do the work of a boy. a road fr appearances wile occasionally require a devia from this rule  for whatever a certain noble lord ray think to the contrary even a curates wife wilel hardly think a donkey cart  a suitable conveyance. where profit is the ques the general rule is to adapt the means to the end  and to be as thrifty as the habits of those with whom we have to deal. and our own charity or delicacy wilel allow. it is for a good reason therefore t Irish landowners are alys so ready to back up the potato.  pat thrives upon it they cry   see what work he does on a good dish of murphies  he would not nk you for bread. in ordinary times nothing can compare we are told with the potato.  bring it into England our provincial philanthropists are exclaiming   give every man his quarter acre of potatoes and he is independent. no need then of poor laws or labor rates happily however nature in a larger sense of t much abused term protests against this deliberate degrada of her sons. every now and then she throws in an item peculiarly her own which fearfully disturbs the false balance of the base calculatino blind ignorance and mad discontent conspiracy and rebellion dearth  pestilence and every other disorder incident to human existence reduced to the very zero of support prove to the statesman if not to the landlord t there must after all be an error in the account. the cheapness of savagery fault to compensate for tube expense of controlling its outbreaks. a na of barbarians may be cheap to the landowner but it is ruinous to the state. a costly soldiery and police must make up for  inferiority of the domestic standard and when the lowest possible average of life sinks occasionally to a level below the stretch of the most elastic endurance the na is called in to supply the terrible gap. t in fact is what the landowners of Ireland are now with an importunity approaching to impudence demanding of the imperial government and legit nature  the. potato has disappointed us for once they say   so you must make it up for this year and help us on to the next. the only use of  is to prop up the potato. instead of considering t whatever is done the wretched. policy of encouraging this crop has already entailed a serious loss to the na by enhancing the price of all other food these gentlemen consider .t the state ielf must immediately aggravate t loss by an immense artificial drain of food into Ireland sure as it is under such peculiar circumstances to be most ntonly squandered.  all t Ireland nts is the potato   but then when the potato fails the whole na is to advance a loan or a gift for it is much the same thing to the amount of three or four million quarters of wheat in order to make up the failure. this is like doing without rm clothing but reproaching ones neighbors with inhumanity because when the winter does at last self in they wilel not part with their blankets. and great coats. if we are exaggerating the tone of these aristocratic mendicants we beg to refer to their wools at a great meeting of landlords held at pasteboard lat Saturday the earl of loan presiding the marquis of sumo proposed and carried  have no

indont preference of reef to labor ading artic Tuesday September 22 1846.   the worst symptoms of the Irish famine have begun to show themselves in the way of popular gatherings and professions which at present are only turbunt but may soon become outrageous. the twin powers of fear and rumor have nt their hands to the coloring of a. picture already sufficiently sombre. the peop have made up their minds to report the worst and believe the worst. human agency is now denounced as in instrumental in adding to the calamity inflicted by heave it is no longer submission to providence but a murmur against the government. the potatoes were blighted by a decree from on high jut labor is defrauded by the machine  of earthly power. sch are the fiat aspira of discontent inflamed by  and diffused by fear. such are tanks that a government gets for attempting to palliate great afflic  satisfy corresponding demands by an inevitab but a ruinous beneficence. i the alarm of the populace in the principal towns has arisen in some cases from the fact of the wages paid by government ling below the average standard of  in the vicinity  in others from the report that it is the intention to reduce them below that standard. this stipe secret of the murmur. but how much dices it disclose  how much does it indicate  it is the old thing  the old. grievance is at the bottom the old  is breaking out. it is the national character the national thoughssness lie national indonce. it is that which demands the attention oi governments of patriots and philanthropists not a whit ss than the potato disease. the government provided work for a peop who love it not. it made this the absolute condition of relief. doing so it  did that which every executive is bound to do in simitar circumstances. but in laying out its plan it was obliged to square the execution of it by the habits of the peop. it knew that the latter would at all trines rather be id tulip toil  would live on a small gratuity mither than large or regular earnings  and would trust to the beneficence of a cabinet rather than to the sweat of their brows or the steady work of their hands.  saw distinctive the prospect of more than half a nation becoming complacently dependent upon specious alms. there was but one way to avoid a calamity compared with which the potato blight is a trivial thing. this was to enjoin that work slovenly and sluggishly performed as government work was sure to be should procure subsistence for the peasant but nothing more.  government was required to ward off starvation not to pamper indonce  its duty was to encourage industry not to stif it  to stimulate others to give employment not to outbid them or drive them from the labor market. it therefore threw itself between the poor man and his gaunt foe  but it would not interfere between. him and his best friend the man who would employ him. it diminished the competition which the laborer had to fear  it increased that which none but a foolish proprietor could dislike. it provided literally bread for the famished but it held out more than bread to the active and industrious. the squire and the farmer found that in order to get laborers at all they must appeal not only to the intelligence the acquisitiveness of the poor. the contest thus arose between the  or  a day of the executive and the ls. or ls.  of the landowner. in England or Scotland any other country but Ireland issue would have been car from the beginning all hands would have tendered their services to the squire or the farmer. the government contractor would have been ft to treat with the refuse of the population private works would have enlisted youth heahvigour activity and zeal. the publ works would have devolved on age infirmity or indonce. but in the end the nation the empire would have gained. on the spur of a temporary emergency permanent improvements would have been effected and normal habits established. the emulation of the peasant would have conspired with the ambition or the avarice of the landlord to redeem the soil of Ireland from the curse of perpetual negct and the condition of Irishmen from the shame of hereditary squalor. that which taught men first of all to work would have taught Irishmen to work well steadily and continuously. hunger would have been as elsewhere the herald of comfort necessity the parent of luxuries. the disappearance of the potato instead of being a curse might have been haid as a boon  and the ceic tilr eating better food and cuivating a nobr crop might have arned to wonder how he could ever have existed on so poor and in nutritious a root. but what would happen in other countries never does happen in Ireland. there the process as well as the motive of every action is inverted. instead of increased exertion and renewed industry passive submission and despondent indonce waid a famine epoch. even the annual migration of labor was suspended in many instances. the english cornfields lacked their wonted reapers. the ceic features and the ceic diact were missed from our northern tn  harvests. the quays of Liverpool and Bristol were unusually scant of tho strongly marked lineaments and that peculiar garb which distinguish the native Irishman from every other denizen of Europe England was rife of  and .muiform speculation. every hand that could be turned to account was pressed into service. our own peasantry ire in many counties insufficient to meet the demands of muiform occupation. still the Irishmanhe who in other and ss happy seasons has filched more than his share from the competition of his english fellowlabore who was erst revid as a pernicious rival but who then would have been hails as a u useful  kindly help mate he kept aloof. here and there yowl might hear the western brogue but almost universally the harvest wooed in vainthe sick of the sister is. why was this 1 why was it that the prospect the certainty of a great calamity did not animate to great exer 1 alas  ti Irish peasant had tasted of famine and found that it was good. he saw the cloud looming in the assistance and he haid its approach. to him it teemed with goodly manna and salient waters he wrapped himself up in the ragged man of inert expectancy and said that he trusted to providence. but the deity of his faith was the government the manna of his hopes was a parliamentary grant. he callas his submission a religious obedience and he believed it to be so. but it was the obedience of a religion which by a small but material change reversed the primeval decree. it was a religion that holds man shall not labor by the sweat of his brow. all this was natural and might have been expected from the original character and antecedent condi of the Irish peop. it was the same rooted and innate disposition which thwarts and  depresses them whithersoever they turn their steps. on  banks of the Liffey or the liver the Thames or the st. Lawrence the Murray or the Mississippi it is the same thing. it is this that prevents them from working when they can id  from growing rich when they work  from saving when they receive money. it seems a law of their beings hard a pitiab a saddening law  but one hitherto unaered and we hope only to external appearanceunaerab. but why is it that in Manchester or  or Stockport when bi works and is well paid the Irishman never thrives 1 he Englishman and the Scotchman from small beginnings strugg into comfort respectability competence   sometimes even into weah and station. the scotch or english spinner in no few caseworms become a manufacturer and a capitalist  the Irish hardly in any. thrown among mechanics of the two nareceiving the same wages as they stimulated by  same competition the same prospect and the same  too at times an equal if not a greater energy still he rarely attains the same position or improves his condition in the same degree he remains if not poor at ast uncomfortab. his family inherit the squalid slovenliness which their father imported. his quarter as may be seen in Liverpool Bristol Manchester Oldham or  always the mot forlorn and cheerss in the district. ahese things are facts beyond doubt and denial we repeat them not for reproach or contumely but to show that there are ingredients in the Irish character which. must be modified and corrected before either individuals or governments can hope to raise the general condition of the peop. it is absurd to prescribe political innova for the remedy of their sufferings or the alviation of their wants. extended suffrage and municipal reform for a peasantry who have for centuries consented to aernate between starvation 011 a potato and the  of national charity  you might as well give them bonbons and ratafias. nothing effectual can be achieved unto the habits of the peop are changed. and this change cannot be effected unss the landowners a. squireen exert themselves. l 2 had the smalr gentry resident in resented by  as correlative with and land done their duty to their tenants and almost dependent on a supply of the dependents for the best landlords in Ireland are its absentee shad they set the examp of attention to their properties aud improvement of their estates the Irish would long ago have repudiated the potato. negcted by others they negcted themselves. hence the universal prostration of self complacent poverty and unrepenting discomfort. we have a great faith in the virtues of good food. without attributing the spndid qualities of the British lion wholly to the agency of beefsteaks we may pronounce that a peop that as been reared on solid edibs will strugg long arid hard against the degradation of a poorer sustenance. the stomach is more than the mind a creature of habit. accustom it to eks or potatoes it is indifferent to a generous diet. once habituate it to substantial solids it rebels against guminous impostures. the consequence is obvious.  venter governed  moline he who is in danger of being starved by idness will make 0 more strugg to earn his bread his beef and his porter. on a question of this kind all agree. the philosopher and the gastronomical   and  framers of the republic and the coterie of the deipnosophists concur in ascribing virtues not roily physical but moral and intelctual to the excelnce of mans food and its variety. the study of justice and the proficiency in political science are repro finest grain and the most whosome meats for our own parts we regard the potato blight as a bssing. when the ces once cease to be  they must become carnivorous. with the taste of meats will grow  with the appetite the readiness to earn them. with this will come steadiness regularity and perseverance  unss indeed the growth of these qualities be impeded by the blindness of Irish patriotism the shortsighted indifference of petty landlords or the random reckssness of government benevonce. the first two may retard the improvement of Ireland  the last continued in a spirit of thoughss concession must impoverish both England and Ireland. but nothing will strike so deadly a blow not only at the dignity of Irish character but also the ements of Irish prosperity as a confederacy of rich proprietors to dun the national treasury and to eke out from their resources that employment for the poor which they are themselves bound to provide by every sense of duty to a land from which they derive their incomes. it is too bad that the Irish landlord should come to ask charity of the english and scotch mechanic in a year in which the export of produce to England has been beyond all precedent extensive and productive. but it seems that those who forget all duties forget all shame. the Irish rent. must be paid twice oyer.,INDOLENT PREFERE~CE OF REL!EF TO LABOUR.,2,9/22/1846
Irish landlords. letter to the  Tuesday September 22 1846 sir you are generally a severe but a tried at least to live with those of both fair censor  at least if you permit attack religions without offending any i have in your columns you insert the defense come to conclusions as to Irish affairs per bear with a few lines in defense of Irish featly different from those now constantly landlords from one who is far more con put forth in your columns and perfeatly nested by property with England than in accordance with the results of your with Ireland  of an english family but commission bo an Irishman  who has lived in ire the income of the whole landed pro land for the last ten years and devoted proprietary of Ireland will not feed the himself to the improvement of an townspeople this year and few of the rents  comparatively populous and nearly will be paid. a grant or loan of less than worthless estate.  will not suffice and owing having gone to Ireland perfeatly free to the rise in prices it is more than from the party feeling which distracts doubtful if that will be enough. that country  having lived with persons now is this caused by high rents by of all politics without expressing any former ejectment by cruelties which you have been denouncing and sometimes fairly denouncing of late  it arises from an overpopulation reduced to the lowest point of subsistence by ignorance improvidence and lawless ness and who would gather from your columns that it has been for many years the great object of nearly every landed proprietor of consequence in Ireland to remedy this evil by promoting emigration increasing the size of farms educating the people and that  these efforts have sprung those calumnies which alas   limes  sent through Europe who would suppose from your articles that Ireland contained such landlords a lord ee a man whose sole pursuit and ambition is not wealth or per aggrandizement but the moral and social improvement of his tenants as the landlords whose estates are managed by  backer a man who has devoted a long and active life to the interest of the small farmers of Ireland as lord Devon the late lord celadon sir Robert Ferguson and hundreds more whose names crowd to my pen 1 these are men to be honored far before any english landlord however good  not that they are by nature better or more liberal but because the life of an Irish landlord who strenuously attempts to improve the condition of his tenants is one continued struggle against the vicious system implanted in the hearts of the people preached from the altars by too many of the priests through which the rights of property are rendered insecure by certain bylaws of the people unknown to tb law of the land  capital is driven away corm the country  a mans qualifications are tested not by his conduct character or ancipital but by his being a Saxon or a celt a protestant or roman catholic. this is the system which makes too often the ignorant and vicious the advisers of the people heaps calumny and outrage on those who would fain benefit them steeps Ireland in poverty and makes Irishmen dependent on potatoes. there are it is true negligent landlords like the marquis of  in the reports of your mm missioner hero are kind but careless landlords like  O'Connell  avocations prevent his care of his estate  but the crime of these men amounts simply to this that while their care of their estates is not less than that of most english landlords  far as per  exertion is conceed while their subscriptions to local charities are far larger in proportion they do not spend their lives and expend their substance in the constant generally thankless often unproductive effort to ameliorate in spite of themselves the condition of the people. and the check being absent and the vicious system of Irish society having full play the land is divided subdivided wo out to the lowest possible point want appears every sg but a failure of potatoes is starvation for a year. now whence arises  things f why is it that the common laws of profit and loss have not prevented or cured this evil 1 how is it that a better system of cultivation is not found to be as in England a matter of profit 1 how is it that the landlord has not preserved farms of such a size and tenants of such a capital that there is a surplus left for rent far more for subsistence even though one crop may fail 1 it arises first from past neglect an evil fast being removed  next from the difference of religion of the owners of the  and of the leaders of the people the priests  but mainly and immediately from the system i have referred to from the want of security of property from the soil being the sole dependence of the people. many and many a landlord has at vast expense to himself assisted to emigrate hundreds of people who in defiance of the terms of some old lease had fastened on his property causing perhaps some present  but saving thereby in the course of years an incredible amount of human suffering. and deep and loud have been the denunciations of those landlords from the altars by those whose dues were thereby diminished. many a Saxon capitalist would have speculated in a country so favored by nature as Ireland and the exports of Irelandwould have been purchased by his money and eaten by those whom he employed but that tie english rights of propped are not recognized by the Irish people. and now they starve  and landlords priests and parsons unite in one cry  feed the people at any cost   and the landlords offer still further to encumber their estates already encumbered by their forefathers to provide the food necessary stipulating only that the wmk for which the food is to be exchanged shall be sigh as will enable them to repay wat they

an  tter to the editor Saturday September 26 1846. sir the general terms in which the resolus passed at pasteboard in the county of mayo on Saturday the 12th inst. were conceived has furnished you with materials to aim a heavy blow and great discouragement in the limes of the 18th to Irish landlords by. a whosa denuncia. by the aid of your criticism then and some other industrious helps on this side  the water the phrase  Irish landlord will soon become absolutely synonymous in the language with inhuman or worse if worse could exist. but an entire class should not be doomed to general odium at ast on the weak assump that the general cultiva of the potato as the food of the Irish peop is a selfish object with Irish proprietors or is a benefit to them. i was never acquainted with any one who had a grain of echoloca and foresight that did not regard that circumstance as a misfortune to the peop and the mode generally pursued in Ieland for the cultiva oh he potato as most injurious to proper if you want to denounce the  of  freeholds up to the year 1825 since when it would have been impossib to make one as the indirect cause of an undue inocrease of popula in a state of wretchedness exert your industry and the great resources of your popular journal to ascertain on whose estates that vas practiced  and if you are disposed to visit the sins of others on the present possessors pubkish their names or suggest ti modern remedy of a committee of the house of commons to allot some recompense from them to ti public that havying passed through atlatl ordeal they may start fairly with others whoso estates were not so prostituted of which latter crass in passing t me  mine was one. but do not one day idea out a kick at the landlords of Ieland and again on another a deadly blow behind the ear and i may  the back of the proprietary of the who island because occasionally in the present crisis the hasty wording of resolus in some locality may ave an opening for attack. it was impossib to read the ab tters written by he limes agent last year without befog convinced that the per wished well to Ieland and desired to inform the British public fairly on the state of its   but it is equally impossib to read the observas in Fridays per without being moved and at ast to notice them as most unfair. i have no more to do with mayo than you have but when you come down upon landlords Irish of course in general as  very unfortunately heartss extravagant and guilty of fully in that sense as well as their predecessors i ask you this ques if the greatest propor of the estates of such persons as are now teeming with an overgrown popula would have been not now so situated but on the contrary had their farms properly divided and cultivated as farms should be provided the perverseness of the occupiers by almost general custom had not disregarded their own contracts and subdivided the lands confided to their possession under directly opposite condis made with providenc and foresight to deter from co nacre and from a ruinous cultiva of and calcula on the potato what becomes of the reasoning of your artic in Fridays per 1 i am sorry some abr hand has not been moved to remonstrate against these renewed.. attacks but i shall not be deterred by prehension of any retort i may draw upon myself from complaining of such monstrous injustice a dispassionate statement will meet the case. the Irish peasant in the extreme west and south of Ieland is not remarkab for foresight t. you confide land to him or as the law terms it he is put into possession of it though he knows nothing of sound agriculture. he abuses that possession in every way. first by bad culture of everything except weed sand next by subdividing it for marriage pors for his sons and daughters. in the lse of a few years therefore a mans estate is so huckstered sold and resold against his wishes and in the teeth of contracts that the proprietor can hardly recognize his own. what is he to do 1 if his pro petty be anything considerab the peop are in the military occupa of it and havying one interest they have one animus that is to renin masters of it on their own terms. the roman catholic cloggy too have an interest in this state of things. they are as every one knows intimately conversant with the affairs of all the families of their flock. that marriages births and burials should go on merrily is their interest. i do not say this now to reproach them with it only the fact is so. indeed i once asked one of them why he married paupers 1 and he answered  if i did not mother would. so thus stand these natters. but what says the law the woe law the engkish law inflicted upon us without the slightest refer enc to the social relas of the peop whose dealings it is to regulate i the prejudices of engkish law riveted by educa in the minds of even Irish lawyers disregard the experience of country gentmen and both in and out of pparliament a sugges stands a bad chance of being listened to u as by their permission i much doubt however if under the meaning of knights and burgesses it was ever originally intended that one of their arned profession should have got into the house of commons at all. try and obtain that a power shall be vested in a local authority as it is in Scotland to prevent the soil the st of the country being the plaything for every ignorant pauper to carve and ruin at his pasure who hpens to be in momentary possession of it. talk of preventing it oh no the lawyer says  eject  him half ruin you and himself and then eject him. this is just the folly and destruc the law  who can eject in Ieland 1 or who will take land from which the popula however they may be to blame have been ejected 7 but at last the arned profession must be forced to give way i means of summary preven must be adopted or it is an injustice nothing ss than infernal to blame Irish landlords as the authors of a condi of things which is working out their own ruin. pparliament must provide that no occupa of any descrip of land in a country so exclusively agricultural as eland is may be encouraged or permitted by law therein without certain and immediate securities to control and enforce contracts that laxity of practice may not as at  chicanery perjury demoraliza and disturbance  that means shall be devised to have agreements promptly enforced of which no man could complain  that over holding should be renderpdanoffencandas much punishab as forcib possession is now considered to be  that persons havying a casual possession of land may be restrained in liming from subdividing the propetty of other persons against the will anil wish of the owners and against the faith of their own contracts instead of drivying proprietors to the remedy of ejectment after the injury is done which Irish tenants in many places now think when used ought to be resented by assassina. pparliament should also provide bans to abridge or diminish the unblushing practice of perjury now so notoriously common in the quarter sessions courts of Ieland by the pointing of officers to take down evidenc as it is delivered where perjury is prehended to serve towards the ends of convic. again that persons for  benefit or internat the owner or tenant of any land is com pellucid by threats or terror to surrender the same may be held responsib as parties now are who are guilty of taking a forcib possession short of this your gislature year after year heing burden upon burden on Irish landlords and the press adding contumely to these injuries are confiscate  under pretexts and nothing ss when you have helped to ruin thousands by bad gisla other proprietors must take their place to be again the victims of the same system but remember always that if the respectab part of the eng kish press even though unwittingly poisons British opinion against a suffering and injured class of their  in Ieland it is at the same time in vol vying British interests to an immense ex tent as much of the soil of Ieland is mortgaged to British cital the land lords whereof are to a great degree ad administrators for those who have nt their money on the faith of the security of propetty which it is the fashion of modern sympathy to attack through the sides of its proprietors. . during the late lord liver pools ad ministra 1 gave evidenc before the committee on Irish disturbances and foretold that unss steps were taken to regulate the occupa of the soil and not ave it to hhazard these periodical famines would press with inocreased severity on the public purse the longer the considera of the subject was postponed and both in and out of pparliament since that time i have pressed the matter upon the atten of every succeeding government  but have invariably been defeated by the black tter gentmen. some years ago when solicited by the late respected  Purcell to become one. of the original members of the agricultural society i answered that until the law of landlord and tenant was put upon a footing of common sense agriculture could at best but make a limping progress in Ieland and that everything else with that ft undone was beginning at the wrong end and i declined it. at this moment one half of the province of Connaught is reduced to absolute barrenness by the burning of the soil to force potatoes and in that part now the distress is the most intense. it could not possibly be otherwise  but as long as the gentmen of the long robe in and out of pparliament are to be the  judges of what is to be done or ft undone the landed interest great and small will be the victims of their prejudices and of their ignorance. for the rest the activity the zeal and intelligenc which the resident gentry of Ieland exhibit to adt the powers of the law to the ocrea  of profitab  the advances made to them by parliament may  honestly and duly repaid to the treasury are a sufficient answer to whatever else may be uncharitably charged upon them. the world will judge whether under the present awful visita they are fulfilling their duties to their god and their country. i am not afraid of any fair  peal to public opinion which can be made. i am sir your obedient servant.

the duty of the government leading article Friday October 9 1846. he position of the minister whom the progress of events the struggles of party the working of public opinion and even the vicissitudes of the sky have conspired to place at the head of this  is one which moralist might select to cure the most insatiable and most daring ambition. in the approaches of a famine aggravated by a social disorder which centuries have been nursing it is his tremendous responsibilit to hold the key of the nationl store. a few years almost a few monts since it was panted out to the admiration of England that the manufacturing masses of Lancashire deprived of employment sat down to die in sight of warehouses full to overflowing with food. that was a noble spectacle and it has told. resignation  wrought a miracle such as the boldest agitators did not venture to expect. would that either the case were as simple the remedy as obvious the people as resigned in the present instance. an island a social state t race is to be changed. the surface of the land its divisions its culture its proprietors its occupiers its habitations its manners its law its language and the heart of a people who for two thousand years have remained unalterable within the compass of those mighty changes which have given us European civilization are all to be created anew. that is only part of tile task which a destiny that berms  mock alike the aspirations of benevolence and of ambition imposes on the minister of this state.. re has not only to feed the people out of an insufficient store but change their very nature meantime. should 110 fail both to meet the crisis and improve the opportunity he will be reproaches not only with the horrors of instant famine but with helping to perpetuate a nationl degradation. lit for a task so far beyond the powers cf man teaches us to spare that discursive variety of suggestions which can ml bewilder and cannot inform. would that we could impress this lesson on the whole multitude of volunteer advisers of tho crown. perhaps it is useless to ask the great agitator for one short month to descend from his hobby  to ask the landlord to forget his rights and the tenant his wrongs  or to entreat all parties to agree to one brief truce of historical grudges. still at the risk of wasting our words we will once more invite all to remember that it is not merely an Irish question not a political question at all we have to deal with. it is an economical question. how are the twenty five millions of these islands to be carried through this twelvemonth and safely into the middle of the next on a seriously insufficient store which it appears impossible meantime to replenish  the question only begins with Ireland all are concerned b  they who are actually perishing are the first to be considered. he Irish must be fed at once. that point is settled. but that done the graver matters of future sustenance and future tranquillit cloud our horizon with dark and ominous ambiguity it is not merely the present failure of the potato but the discovery that it is not to be depended upon that we have to confront to subdue or to mitigate. there is a melancholy concurrence in the opinions of most Irishmen that five years at least must  before in any part of Ireland the peasantry will be able to raise a new species of food. and even this hypothesis is made on grounds more favorable than a minute contemplation of the earn warrants us in assuming. five years must elapse before even the more docile and. tractable portion of the peasantry will be able to cultivate a new and different species of food. but how long a period must intervene before the more intractable the  impatient and the more despondent part of them habituate themselves to the idea much more to the study of a novel and unwonted agriculture  a length of  than we like to revolve in  minds must pass over ere the tillage be changed and the subsistence of the people created afresh. what is to be done in the interval 7 already the complaint is that the baronies have overtaxed themselves  that they are assessed to the  far above their actual value. ts by itself would be found to be a serious inconvenience were the calamity whew it is proposed to obviate of a temporary nature. but this is not so.  most sanguine dare not hope that one year will bound the sweep and severity of our affliction. the remedy therefore which applied to the first years evil would be inconvenient is when proposed for the second impossible or ruinous. to repeat the process of supersaturation renew the great promissory note to governmentt would be simply to beggar the landowners without conferring a permanent benefit on the people or what is equally important a permanent improvement on the land. the landlords would fly from while their tenants would perish on soil exhausted by mortgages and crowded with a famished and reckless population. frightful as such a state of things would be it is no vague picture of tie imagination it is just the very state to which Ireland must inevitably be reduced if the sums now collected and about to be collided are flung y on works which will add noshing to the nationl wealth and supply nothing to the nationl want. the first object of governmentt after ding the best as we admit lord Bess borough seems k be doing for the immediate exigency should be fo provide against its certain recurrence  to devise means for making the famine of the next year less oppressive than that of the present and that of the following easier than that of the next  so that the weight of suffering may be diminished season by season until providence has blessed the industry of the people and the energy of their advisers by new modes and new fruits of husbandry. this can only be effected by taking such measures as shall insure the cultivation the renewed the general and the indefatigable cultivation either of such grain as may itself feed. the people or be exported as the medium of procuring for them a proper food. to this object the attention both of governmentt and of landed proprietors should be directed. in this as in every other emergency which demands vigor of design and promptness of execution the plans of tho landlord will be thwarted and his directions contravened by the inextricable perplexities which beset the Irish question. that we must expect. there will be difficulty beyond what Englishmen find it easy to conceive in inducing the Irish peasant to till acres for the reception of other crops than the potato. will the difficulty be too great for the landlord to overcome 1 will it be great enough to shift upon the governmentt  this problem must sooner or later be solved. governmentt has become a large moneylender. it may have to become so again even on a more comprehensive scale. but it hardly appears as yet that governmentt has succeeded in getting that which ordinary moneylenders never fail to obtain security suppose the land. owners find themselves unable to repay iv hat has been advanced them by pallia  this is no extravagant supposition what then  what remedy will the governmentt have 1 none that we can see  at least none that would be worth a moments effort or a farthings outlay. but if the money now advanced. by the treasury be sacrificed to project of lavish but useless expenditure to the construction of traffic less roads and ship. less harbormaster to the mere equipment of private luxury and comfort then indeed will the stewards of the imperial purse have complicated a great wernerite with a great injustice by lavishing  loans without a guarantee either for their discharge or their safe and profitable investment. it has therefore been suggested that governmentt should constitute itself a mortgage on a large seals and should itself enter on the lands which  by its advances leaving of course to the proprietor his equity of redemption. that such a scheme should have been thought of for one moment only proves the desperate character of the emergency. nothing in fact could be more contrary to the genius of a constitutionl governmentt which Rollins tr. be an impartial arbiter between all classes and never scends from  council room to occupy the place of any subordinate vocation. a British premier will probably feel as great a scruple to play the part of a nationl landlord as to intrude into the office of judge.  a scheme would in feat only be adding new elements of disorder to a chaos which already confesses the presence of too many. henceforth the nationl landlord the national tenant the nationl agent  leases nationl processes of distress would be added to the dramatists person that already so uncomfortably crowd the stage. if so much is now expected from the worth the abilit and forbearance of the private landowner what extravagant expectations would usher in the reign of the nationl proprietor  but it is easier to raise objections to such a scheme than to refute them. the scriptural character of the precedent claims for it at least a decorous reception. but it would be difficult to establish a parallel between the patient children of ham the pharaohs and the delta of the  on the one hand and the celt the British governmentt and the emerald isle on the other. vv can only class the scheme with those dreamy projects which impracticable as they may be in themselves like the mysterious gleams of morning twilight do at least prepare for great changes. and he must indeed be blind who does not see that the present relation of rich and  in Ireland must precede some great revolution in the tenure of landed property.,THE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMEN,2,10/9/1846
food exports from eland to England leading article Friday October 30 1846 the BrIrish islands small as they are in comparison either with the sy of which they are the headquarters or with the neighboring continental empires contain within themselves the materials for some of the most remarkable problems the face of all this earth can supply. it is true that we do not suffer either the blot of legal slavery or its bitter results in a domesticated negro population  r plantations are not fringed with caff res or red Indians  r downs are not scred by Bedins or callbacks r conquerors and r conquered are not wholly unmixed. so far there seems no discrepancy which a few generations might not be thght engh to overcome. yet within 24 hrs of this great metropolis there are differences which as to their substantial weight and effects may well compare to the more picturesque diversities to which we have alluded. England and leland each as a whole are as strange opposites as fertile subjects for speculation as inexplicable an enigma to the statesmen as the city of the czar and the half continent of serfdom by which iris sustained. as is commonly the case with the greatest questions some degree of distance is necessary to a just estimate of relative positions occupied by  two portions of the empire. the benefit of distance is enjoyed and freely used by r neighbors every politician of Europe is able and alys ready to discuss the Hibernian controversy with a freedom of opinion and a largeness of view almost intolerable even to the most liberal minded Englishman we do not stop to inquire how far jealsy ever searching for blots on the escutcheon of greatness has seduced the foreign spectator into an impracticable and unreal estimate of r internal relations  nor will we ask how far England may retaliate the reproach. such however is the largeness of survey to be acquired or at least to be witnessed in a brief sojrn among another people language and laws. it can too he predicted with certainty that distance of tine will have a corresponding effect. the historian of future ages will review the quarrel of the Saxon and the celt with wonderful impartiality. he will visit upon r own heads tat noble simplicity of survey that unsparing generosity of sentiment with which we are accustomed to treat the trages and tyrannies of classic or of medieval antiquity. if we hope to anticipate and perhaps to avert the judgment of posterity it is r place to aim at this distance. it must be obtained by an effort of the incl by a comprehensive and resolute grasp at all the conditions and fact of the question. nor can we dbt that the question is now on the point of receiving a far more dispassionate and comprehensive survey. to this hope we are encraged by the fact that many other social questions have lately received a similar emancipation. for example we are now able to perceive and lament how many items r forefathers omitted in computing the losses and gains of r colonial empire on a protective system we see how serisly they were imposed upon by the fallacy of an upper current of fictitis advantage. the Irish question is equally treachers to a superficial survey when fut tire economists strike the balance of favors and duties between England and ire land they will probably scrutinize the traffic of the Irish channel more closely than  are wont to do. they will insist much on the fact that the food of millions will annually pass to the richer and happier shore. they will not reconcile this with the alleged improvidence oi the Irishman quite so easily as we are wont to do. they will inquire very diligently what England gave in return. when their researches bring them to that crisis which we are now actually suffering they certainly will be struck perhaps even unduly by the fact that while England s avowedly feeding ielandwhile both cntries agreed in that view of their position while all classes of Irishmen were flinging themselves more and more upon the bnties of the empire whole fleets of provisions were continually arriving from the land of starvation to the ports of wealth and the cities of abundance. scarce a day passes witht every great port of this cntry seeing this visible contradiction or rather this painful anomaly. we are emphatically reminded that it is not to ieland her self but to her social state that the famine is attributable. this is no ex exaggeration no paradox. what also will the future historian feel when in the very columns which he is searching for the distracting and harrowing notices ofIrish destitution he lights on such a paragraph as tit which appeared in r yesterdays impression and which in fact is only one t of the many we cld quote from the last few weeks   no  than 16 ships arrived in the river Thames on Monday from the Irish ports laden almost exclusively with food and provisions of varis kinds the produce of that cntry having collectively 14960 packages of butter 224 packages of pork 1047 hampers and bales of bacon several of hams 140 sacks 2926 barrels and 7788 quarters of opts 434 packages of lard 75 of general provisions 40 of oatmeal 44 of porter 259 boxes of eggs and a variety of other articles of lesser importance which it wld be quite needless further to particularize. of these almost unprecedentedly numers arrivals in one day from the sister island 5 were from limerick 1 from Belfast 2 from ter ford 1 from galy 1 from bulrush 2 from Dublin 1 from  and 3 from cork. of crse to a certain extent every well informed person will be prepared for such an annncement and will not feel his sense of . injustice or his humanity wnded. there are large agricultural districts of England which transmit to their wealthier or more populs neigh boyhoods supplies of provisions which the poverty producers might equally covet at home. the united states indeppendent as they are of BrIrish rule may occasionally present the spectacle of feeding us t of their poverty. there is no inequality in an interchange of clothing and food. ieland might owe as. much to England as England to her  the other hand history suggests too many instances of imperial states subsisting xing fat and nton on the vital wealth of their dep pendent provinces. it informs us of a certain tendency under given circumstances to a great equality of relations. so it is at least possible for a fertile and populs region to suffer a perpetual drain of itsresrces its vast population may do nothing but expedite the bnties of nature and transmit her bnties untasted to meet the relentless demands of some foreign master. it is possible that there may be no equiv lent no return to be hoped no debt to be repaid. this may then be the case of ieland. this inquiry we think is now like to receive an acuate and authentic deter mi nation it may be put in some such form as the following suppose for. the purposes of the calculation that ieland is an indeppendent cntry. its economists will frequently compare the value of its exports and imports. shld they find the balance against them they will naturally conclude in the first instance that the cntry is in debt and the excess against them is nothing else than the annual payment of the interest int. this debt however they will of crse inquire looking for either a formal or at least a substantial existence. of the former there must be some record. the latter viz the nail benefit received and discharged by a continual exportation of produce must be capital in some shape or other invested in the soil. if there have been no real loan no advance of money no tangible assistance no consideration received in any formic there are no wealth laid t on the land no artificial property fairly attributable to that relentless foreign debtor then it is hard to escape the inference that there exists some sort of oppression  and that the excess of exports over imports is not the interest of a just debt but the tribute of a weak and conquered realm.,FOOD EXPORTS FROM !RELAND TO ENGLAND,2,10/30/1846
state aid to public works. Saturday October 31 1846. from the times correspondent Dublin oct. 29. letter from lord j Russell the evening post the government organ contains the following letter addressee by lord john Russell to his grace the duke of Leinster i  downing street oct. 17. my der  royal agricultural society of which you are the head  a deputation not long ago to the lord lieutenant representing that instead of public works of an unprofitable nature the baronies should have power  undertake works of a useful and profitable nature. it had been our hope and expectation that landed proprietors would have commenced works of drainage and other improvements on their own account thus employing the people on their own estates and rendering the land more productive for the future. in that case it would have been only the surplus labor which would have been employed on roads and  works not immediately profitable. ..   the act however was put in operation in the baronies in a spirit the reverse of that which i have described. it was taken for granted that the public works were the chief objects to be regarded  and proprietors began to calculate that as so large a sum was to be  repaid from their estates they should not be able to commence or even to continue private enterprises for the improvement if their own lands. . when the case was brought before the government by the lord lieutenant we lamented the wrong direction in which the act had been turned  but admitting the necessity of the case and anxious to obtain the willing cooperation of the landlords we authorized the lordlier  tenant to. deviate from the letter of the law and gate our sanction for advances for useful and profitable works of a. private nature. but after having incurred this responsibility i am sorry to.  that in several parts of Ireland calls are made upon the government to undertake and perform tasks which are beyond the power and apart from the duties of government.  for instance it seems to be expected that we should not only pay an unusual rate of wages but that we should maintain in this time of scarcity the usual price of food. a moments thought will show that this is impossible. a smaller quantity of food is to be divided among the same number of human beings. it must be scarcer  it must be dearer. any attempt to feed one class of the people of the united kingdom by the government would if successful starve another part  would feed the producers of potatoes which had failed by starving the producers of wheat barley and oats which had not failed. all that we have undertaken with regard to food therefore is to endeavor to create a provision trade at fair mercantile prices where no provision trade has hitherto existed and where without assistance none might be willing to undertake a new and unpopular occupation.  but that which is not passible by a governmental is possible by individual and social exertions. every one who travels through Ireland observes the large stacks of corn which are the produce of the late harvest. there is nothing to prevent the purchase of grain by proprietors or by committees and the disposal of these supplies in shops furnished on purpose with flour rot a fair price with a moderate profit. lis has been done i am assure din parts of the highlands of Scotland where the failure of potatoes has been as great and as severe a calamity as it has been in Ireland.  there is no doubt some inconvenience attending even these modes of interference with the market price of food. but the good overbalances the evil. local committees or agents of landowners can ascertain the pressure of distress measure the wants of a district and prevent waste or misapplication. besides the general effect is to bring men together and induce them to exert their energy in a social effort directed to one spot  whereas the interference of the state deadens private energy prevents forethought and after superseding all other exertion finds itself at last unequal to the gigantic task it has undertaken.   there are other questions however extending beyond the exigency of the day which it seems to me demand the attention of the landed proprietors of Ireland much more than that of the government.  it has been calculated that one fifth of the cultivated land in Ireland has hitherto produced potatoes after the present lamentable failure what course is to be taken 1 some men of science deem that the potato can no longer be relied upon as an article of food others say that time may remove tile disease the editor of the gardener. chronicle states that the explanation of the potato disease founded on the hypothesis of some unknown miasma cannot dissatisfactory but neither can it be rejected seeing how signally all other explanations have failed. seeing then that science furnishes us with no means of estimating the effects of the prevalent disease upon the potato plant in future years it would be impossible for the government with any propriety to give any advice to the owners or occupiers of land in Ireland. they must form their own conclusions from facts that are known and the experience of the present and past years.  it is clear however that potatoes cannot be relied upon as they have been hitherto. a cottier cannot hope to be able to pay a large rent for co nacre and the farmer cannot hope to obtain the cottiers labor by allowing him land for potatoes which may probably fail. it is therefore a most important question for the people of Ireland in what manner the deficiency of food is in future to be supplied. the nature of tho grain or root which is best adapted for this purpose  the course ct husbandry which ought fo be followed  tb means of procuring seed  all these are important problems to which the attention of the agricultural society of Ireland cannot too soon be directed.  one thing is certain  in order to enable Ireland to maintain her population her agriculture must be greatly improved. cattle corn poultry pigs eggs butters and salt provisions have been and will probably continue to be her chief articles of export. but beyond the food exchanged for clothing and colonial products she will require in future a large supply of food of her own growth or produce which the laborer should be able to buy with his wages. in effecting this great change much good might ultimately be done. but unless all classes co operate and nee the infliction of providence with fortitude and energy the loss of the potato will only aggravate the woes and s sufferings of Ireland.  such then is the great lesson which by the influence of the higher classes and of such good landlords as yourself may be taught to the Irish people. they should be taught to take advantage of the favorable condition of the soil and surrounding sea to work patiently for themselves in their own country as they work in London and Liverpool for their employers  to study economy cleanliness and the value of time  to aim at improving the condition of themselves and their children.  i would here conclude this letter which is already too long but i cannot do so without expressing my conviction that there is every disposition in persons of property in Ireland to meet their difficult ties fairly and submit to any sacrifices which the public good may require.  i remain my dear duke yours very faithfully  Russell

reliane on state help. leading article Monday Nomber 2 1846. the plot thickens in Ireland it appears to be the order of the day that erybody shall do exactly that which he ought not to do. a sort of st.  dane has seized the whole population and made their limbs rebellious not merely to reasonable authority but to common sense and sound instinct itself. the people are erywhere deserting profitable labor preparation for next year  indefinitely suspended. the few cultivators worthy of beige calks farmers say with what truth we know not that the can scarcely get hands at any price men employed at good pay good english  railroads and en on ironworks are deserting. they are corning en from Scotland and the north of Ireland the cry is gone forth that they are to be employed at  public works which said  public works  are to be brought as near to their  homes as my suit their connience. the golden vision of 500 men employed on as many yards of useless road under the superintendence of one little clerk armed with a notebook and a pen and making their own engagements possesses orpowering charms to the Celtic imagination. as for the farmers such as there are who are worthy of the name it must be confessed that they are in a dilemma. en if they wish to do right. in one point we suspect that there is no great disagreement between them and the laborers they are not desirous to spend much in regular wages for profitable labor they seemed disposed to adjourn all operations particularly the operation of paying rent sine die. they who wish to be honest are sell mg their corn. it is hower too evident that there is a tendency to hold it on speculation. it is expected with a degree of modesty  peculiar to Ireland that gornment is to bring the produce of all the  ery cottage door in the island buying at a famine price and cling at a charity price while the stacks of grain in the country are to remain untouched the stores of the world are to be first exhausted in feeding the Irish peasant and then his next door neighbor is to command his own prices in the market. so prone is the Irish genius to rich unreasonable expectations so little is it to be trusted for a just sense of social proprieties that we fear the effect upon it of en a prudent alarm as to the probable range of prices.. a hint of what may be possibly got for corn next summer is enough it seems to stir up the cupidity of the Hibernian corn dealer of whater class not merely to the most extravagant expectations but to the molly unreasonableness demands. an english farmer may ha his own opinion as to the next summers prices but he does not act upon it for the simple reason that he has his rent to pay and must pay it. so in the face of his own prognostications he sells the fruit of his labors at half its future value. while the tenantry of England and of the greater part of the world is under this iron yoke the Irish tenants are claiming exemption. they ask for a little elbow room in the general squeeze that they  conrt it to their own advantage  are aware that the former does not always find it safe to transmit his produce to the port or the market. it is hower a matter for inquiry what proportion such outrages as the stoppage and plunder of corn and flour bears to the cases where a transit has been or might be safely attempted. are there no small holders of corn at the bottom of  tumults 1 the difficulty of transit is a capita excuse for those who do not wish to sell their crop or pay their rent. we hear on all sides that there is a great tendency to speculation and that among ry Ismail capitalists. they fany they can get more by holding their corn than by sowing it. a singular correspondence between a commissariat officer and a proprietor throws some light upon this state of things as far as concerns one of the most destitute districts the celebrated region of Connemara the officer writes to offer the services of gornment in aid of any local exertions. he makes what we in this country would consider some sensible mos. he finds himself checkmated by the invincible helplessness of the sufferer. the first question is whether any relief committees ha ebon formed or what steps ha been taken thereto. the answer is that one has ry lately been named for two half parishes but that the vice lieutenant has not yet constituted it. so in fact through a complication of delays nothing has been done. the officer then suggests a local subscription for the purchase and sale of meal and offers a gornment contribution in aid. the answer is that nothing to speak of can be counted on the spot. the landlords ha receid no rents and cannot subscribe. the tenants ha paid no rents and will not subscribe. whater is done must be done. by gornment. the officer mentions the impression of gornment that there still are oats and barley in the country and that it is desirable to conrt thorn into food. as mills are wanted he offers to supply any number of handbills at  apiece. the reply is that  the corn that may be in the country is fast rising up. this smacks of the speculation we ha mentioned abo. doornail unusually good yield of corn of all kind sis rising so there is to be nether rent nor wages nor subscriptions nor corn mills nor anything in fact except a gornment importation and a consequent exhaustion of all other stocks. but this ry hopeful gentleman proceeds to assert that the barley and oats in the country will be wanted for sedan excuse too transparent to conceal the real reason. as for the  handbills they are he  too dear en for the funds of a relief committee  and he rather sneeringly suggests that the best use gornment can put them to is to grind for immediate use the here and rye it has been importing for seed. all that he can suggest in return for the advice and benevolence of the commissariat is that it should establish a cheap shop at his own village. while this melanholy work is going on in a district of Connemara it is repeated on a larger scale between the prime minister and Irelands only duke. the royal agricultural society of Ireland of which the duke of Leinster the head ha been sending a deputation asking that the baronies should l1a power to undertake . works of a useful and profitable character. lord john Russell has met that demand the baronies now ha that power. his lordship hower avails himself of the opening afforded by that demand to address to the president of the association a letter full of suggestions so good that ones only regret is to think how little they are likely to be acted upon. the keynote of the letter is  why come to us  do all this for yoursels with a gentleness of reproach not too gentle we hope for its object the noble writer says  drain and impro on your own account purchase grain yourselssell it cheap yoursels if necessary secure the food in the country look to future year stake a lesson from the present do not always hang upon unteach your people independence if the words are mild ner was advice enforced by a.. grar occasion or more terrible apprehensions. what the duke of Leinster and the landlords are to do we will oursels hardly nture to advise. we belie that they declare themsels ruined. they ha suburbanite to presentments vastly beyond the powers of repayment simple to sa their lis  partly also in the hope that the debt after all will not be exacted. let them not lay that flattering unction to their souls. he taxpayers in this empire are too old to subsidize Irish landowners. if the land must change hands the result will be accepted with great tranquillity. the people of England will not apply to others a harder rule than they obey themsels. first or last in one way or another they feed and maintain their own poor  an they will deem it no small mitigation of the present calamity that it compels the application of the rule to Ireland it is almost impossible to treat on any Irish subject without the risk of stinging national pride or

sister island the slightest accent of advice is repelled as an insolent dictation and the smallest word of remonstrance is denounced as cruel insulting and inhuman as if there were not enough already to employ mems attention and monopolize their energies the opinions of english writers are seized on with a reckless  the flames of international discord and foment the fury or political strife. it becomes therefore a difficult matter for a journalist to comment upon any events which relate to Ireland without exposing himself to misconstruction and abuse. if he speak of Celtic  . deuce he is reproached for speaking lightly of the dispensations of heaven. if he recommend. particular  saving provSions or employing labor a yell is  him for giving a stone to a people clamorous for bread. this is in public meetings and political. gatherings.  we trust that. there are men of influence in Ireland with clear judgments and unprejudiced minds. who recognize a duty higher than that of pandering to tb pasSions of a mob and who would welcome from whatever quarter it came any feasible suggestion for provding a practical relief of the present distress. we nave at different times copied from provncial papers accounts of. a partial escape of the potatoes from the prevailing blight. in some counties it would seem that marly half were not affected by it. but it nowhere appears that any measures live been taken to turn this blessing to its full account. no one among the peasantry appears to have thought it worth while to make an attempt at saving that which had been so long unscathed. and no one among the gentry seems to have impressed upon the minds of his dependents the duty of doing all in their power to secure for the emergencies of the coming year that which provdence had spared from the too widespread infection. of this. the same barbc thoughtlessness which congregates hundreds together in the hope of getting food without money or wages without work makes them treat with contempt all recommendations of. patient industry and painstaking precaution. another instance of want of foresight or want of energy has lately been exhibited in regard to the resent state of the Irish fisheries. the provncial journals have on several occaSion within the last few weeks mentioned that there has been an unusual quantity of pilchards and herrings on. the southern coast this year ass generally  there is an abundance of fish off Ireland the only persons who profit by it are the fishermen from the english coast. with a new kind of food brought as it were provdentially within their reach the Irish people sill reject the means of staving off famine. a cry is sent forth from one end of the country to the other that men and women are perishing of want  yet not  effort is made not an arm is extended to seize not a mere article of necessary food but that which compared with their common sustenance would be a luxury even when it is brought almost to their doors  it is of no use to say that an unforeseen evil has paralyzed all exertion and subdued all energy. a season like the present only illustrates more strongly the ten denies of national habits and the misfortune of their long indulgence it is not the affliction of this year that has repressed the native enterprise of the Irish people or tamed their  but it is their orch nary listlessness h is their innate wat of enterprise their indifference to present comfort and future wants that has made the sufferings of this year more intense than they need be. this year only presents to view an extreme instance of that which has happened in other years. the traveler will often be astonished by that which so forcibly struck our own  the neglect with which the Irish treat that which might be made a perpetual source of competence if not of wealth to them. the sea round the southern coasts teems with fish. in scull bay and crook haven they are so plentiful that the sealants often knock them on their heads with oars yet will not take the trouble of netting them. they rather starve in the midst of the national wealth which they leave to be gleaned byte bolder efforts of the Cornish or Devonshire adventurer. they sit in their squalid huts content to season their scant potato diet with a solitary herring and beg of their neighbors or strangers or governments the case may Bethe remnant of their wretched fare. let it not be said that we are taunting misery or upbraiding famine. we are pointing out a malady in the national character which has  and induced a more fearful malady in the physical condition of the people. the want of food this year results in some l degree from want of enterprise in vast l years. had the Irish peasantry been en. courage to male use of the national 1 advantages which their country possesses they would not now be bickering i against taskwork or plundering prov Sion stores. had they exhibited the same prudent energy in clubbing together to man fishing boats that they do on the spur of an english harvesting they would not have seen a valuable trade pass into lien hands or have found themselves so helpless in a great social crisis. let no man think that we intend to lay the whole blame on  untaught Celtic peasant and his hereditary character. character is always modified by circumstances and molded by instruction. heaven knows that he has been disciplined in  hard school. his circumstances have ever been rugged  his instructors inept or perverse. they have taught him in tums everything but that which was most necessary for him to know. they have fostered every pas.Sion which they ought to have quelled and forgotten every lesson which they ought to have inculcated. they have made  a partisan of clans families factions and creeds not of cleanliness prudence or persevering industry. he has learned to hate whom his liberator reviles and curse whom his pies denounces. he votes with his land lord and against him blesses or execrates him according to the dictation of the altar or the corn exchange. three and only three human objects fill the void of his Sindhis land lord  his priest. but not one of these has ever deigned to tell him the familiar lesson known to every village hind in  unless he works he cannot save and that if he does not save he must starve. he struggles on from one year . to another of contented wretchedness  then comes a year of evil and great suffering and lo  the state to which the idols of his mind have reduced him,NEGLECT OF AVAILABLE FOOD SUPPLIES,2,11/5/1846

waste lands in Ireland . letter to the editor Friday November 20 1846. sir would you allow through your columns a few brief observations on reclaiming waste lands in Ireland  i beg to premise that Irish waste lands generally speaking mean bogs or peat soils and that these substances in Ireland possess a peculiarly antiseptic quality and to such high degree as not alone to preserve matter from decay but to confer a power to resist decay. fertile la ids have wholly different agencies. reclaimed Irish wastes have ever a tendency to fall back into their original state and exertions must be constantly applied to overcome their strong natural inclination to sterility. hue we see any successful instances of redeemed land almost invariably confined to cattier gardens bog skirts and pattern annexed to old lands all continuously turned up manured c. the crops on  reclaimed  wastes in Ireland are more subject to failure or blight than crops on the old lands. i have seen crops entirely blasted in one night on the former grounds whilst the same crops on the old land alongside growing from the same seed sown at the same time and cuivated in the same manner remained untouched and unharmed. the expense of reclaiming Irish wastes exceeds the market price of the fee of the best old lands. look at the price paid to reclaim Strafford or chat moss and these  concerns very different in qualities from a rale genuine Irish bog.  would be desirable if the advocates for reclaiming would point out a single example of a reclaimed Irish waste where the expenditure  riot exceed the purchase money of an equal extent of good old enclosed land and where tendencies to deterioration avo not appeared. but suppose for the instant that reclaimed wastes were profitable and safe investments i ask would the Irish people 0 on such territory be better oft than the Irish people on the old territory 7 where is the hope  is character to be changed 1 are social institutions to be amended  or are we to supposal that misery will lose her sting from having new regions to develop her qualities  it is supposed that a proprietary cui viator class would arise on reclaimed lands and present to us through men laboring for themselves blooming fields and happy homes. there is a something more wanted to attain these ends than the condition of every man working for himself and on his own grounds. the grounds must have the capability of re paying the labor expended on them c Irish wastes have not this capability. instead of blooming fields crested by the penates and lares and all the household gods we might behold blighted fields and cheerless crown less hearths. in place of shepherds nightly nodding  their flocks we might have fiery ces and their shivering wives and families huddled together on rushes or fern the difficuy is gigantic from having a population stimulated and left dependent on an unsafe and acclimated plant  are we to add to all our perplexities by  home colonization on unsafe lands f the Irish people were given a peculiar foreign vegetable for food subject to total blast and destruction  are  now to place them on a territory on which all food crops without distinction are limitable to failure and annihilation  we must turn our attention to the old enclosed lands for security and employment i refer to the evidence published some years since by order of parliament relating to this matter and particularly to that of the officer of v. pods and forests sent to Ireland he emphatically deposed that we should look solely to the old enclosed lands to obtain the prosperity of Ireland mighty sintered are at stake. we cannot tamper arid dare not try experiments. if Ireland is to support the Irish people it is clear the action must be on her employers and food producers. to this end let us forthwith ascertain the liabilities of support in each parish. the english people are deeply concerned in this and every consideration urges on them to press the legislature to provide that the poor in each parish in Ireland shall be set to work under the poor law of Elizabeth  17. an Irish landowner,WASTE LANDS IN IRELAND,3,11/20/1846

your mind many of e charges which you have so frequent urged against e resident proprietors of Ireland and show your readers at e cause of our social disorganization arises from laws over which e proprietors and ratepayers have no control and which ey have done all in eir power to get changed for just enactments at would prevent care and industry being swamped  ignorance and neglect. many of e

law e late act of parliament charges em in addition wi a proportion of f neglected labor on all e oer glands in o district  e consequence is quite obvious  and e complaint you have so frequent made of e laborers being dis mimed must follow as no man can take his own proportion on himself and e government fund is called on flor e employment of e entire mass. i venture to say if e downland system were adopted as recommended by e agricultural association of Ireland or even if proprietors were permitted to relieve emselves from all toer responsibility by employing e tlabor on eir lands at eir own expense at a very large reduction would soon appear in e number of ose who are now employed by e government and one pa at least left open for restoring labor to its natural channel. i have e honor to remain sir your obedient servant a county of limerick proprietor croon Ireland  19. at an extraordinary presentment sessions meeting of e magistrates and cess payers of e barony of cosh ma held under e proclamation of e lord lieutenant at croon on sday e 17 inst. e earl of dun raven in e chair e following resolutions were unanimous adopted   resolved at while we willing tax ourselves for e support of e poor in is seas rm of dear and misery we deprecate in e strongest terms e laws at force us to waste e property and labor of e country in works which are useless and in many instances injurious and which under no oer circumstances would be eier proposed or tolerated.  at wi every anxiety to carry out e principle contained in  barouches letter by presenting for works of a reproductive nature we find it impossible to do so from e conditions wi which it is clogged e croon electoral district alone of e barony containing 48 downlands and e oer ree districts near e same proportion rendering it quite impossible to combine em or obtain e acquiescence of e several proprietors many of whom are absentees resident abroad not even represented here.  at unless some simple meod be devised by which each downland may be enabled to app e amount of labor for which it is to be taxed to works of utility e present ruinous system must continue which cannot fail to prove fatal to all classes in e country by confiscating e property of e gentry and laying e foundation of future destitution for e peasantry widrawing eir labor from e cultivation and improvement of e soil.  at we are willing to charge ourselves wi e destitute labor on our estates to find for such labor full employment at fair wages provided e destitution upon neighboring properties shall not be chargeable on our lands. all we require is an amendment of e laws obliging each downland to provide for its own laborers as far as 50 per cent. of its value after which we submit at e remaining distress on such downlands should be met by some general arrangement of government.  at in our opinion if ese principles were carried out by just and equal legislation forcing all proprietors or eir tenants to take charge of e population on eir respective estates or at if neglected a moiety of such estates should be confiscated to e poor ereon under such laws exertions would follow productive of general benefit by giving an individual interest which would cause a rapid advancement of agricultural and manufacturing industry productive of great profit to e industrious proprietor and of certain employment to  laboring classes of is country.  at if is stimulant be not given and at e mass of destitute laborers now over 2000 persons employed in is barony at e public expense continue to be rown into one common stock chargeable on e barony at large it mute end in e total confiscation of e estates leaving e country a waste and rowing e laboring population entire on e government for sup port.  at e maintenance of e vast multitude of 2000 laborers and eir families chargeable on so small district has made o fear of confiscation invade every mans mind and parazes e individual exertions of all persons who consider e likelihood of losing all benefit from eir industry by e general and indiscriminate charge on eir properties of e surplus labor of e country.  at ese resolutions be transmitted by our

landlords and the poor law. leading article Wednesday Nomber 25 1846. . the proceedings of the extraordinary baronial sessions at croon are considered by tho  county of limerick proprietor who has recommended them to our notice entirely conclusi as to the good intentions of his class and the clumsy and ruinous character of the recent ministerial measures we are aware that it is thought exceedingly impertinent to defend a gornment or a legislature or anything else in the world when a dy of Irish landowners is concerned. en if it is obvious on the simplest reflection that wo are speaking the language and advocating the institutions which we ha belch taught to nerate from childhood itself it is assumed  our argument is nothing more than a mischievous weapon seized on the spur of the moment for the purpose of discharging it t the devoted head of the Irish landlord. it is as Englishmen that we write. vv desire to propagate the laws we enjoy er ha enjoyed to our gain. vv really cannot oblige our friends across the channel by forgetting that system of public charity in the heart of which we had the happiness to  rn and to which we partly trace the immeasurable difference between the condition of the Irish peasant and tho english lab cu er. we are habituated to it. all our ideas of relief are cast in that ancient mold when therefore we are invited to gi our advice and our money to relie the distresses of Ireland uncivil and obtrusi as some may think it we cannot help lamenting the absence of our own poor laws such as they ha been till lately and such as Ireland at least requires  nor can  e help deprecating the obstinate ingenuity with which  Irish landowners continue en now to reject them. he resident gentry of the barony of cosh ma ha made the notable discory that th the original  e oi the poor employment act and the ex tended previsions set forth in   letter are liable to ry serious objections. the former taxes all the proprietors ry heavily  quite indiscriminately for public works generally of lit value sometimes positily injurious and always tending to demoralize the peasantry by withdrawing them from agriculture arid encouraging the taste for combination. the latter is tedious and difficult of application by requiring many consents by such cautious provinces nothing can be more philosophical than the tone of the resolutions at croon on this subject. but there are people who Shays talk wisely. they ner say a foolish thing. unfortunately y seem to suffer what may be described in medical language as a determination of wisdom to  tongue  for heans sake font talk so wisely we are ready to exclaim   just gi your fingers a turn. act as wisely as you talk. to what purpose is it to pro that impromptu measures are characterized by a waste of power and a clumsiness of application  when you close your shutters because your windows are broken by a hailstorm do you expect to ha light as well as shelter 1 when the crew of a foundering ssel commits itself to a raft does it expect dry berths and ten knots an hour  when your horses upset your carriage in a storm leaving you to get or fi miles of muddy lane as best you can in what condition do you expect to arri at your j moneys encl  of course extraordinary measures always are imperfect. makeshifts always are bad. it is a fitting retribution to improvidence that they should be so. there must be loss of power and erything else in continual alterations and corrections of policy. the resident gentry in the barony of cosh ma are only telling the  and lord john Russell what they know too well already. from the inherent vices of er extraordinary measure attempted for  the only real escape is a permanent system such as that which has worked so well in this country for nearly three hundred years. hower the law cobblers of the county of limerick learn no such salutary lesson. they wish to go on plaything still it is amusing to obser with only a temporary  the ry first words of the first resolution betray the pious horror with which they recoil from a permanent system.  resold that while we willingly tax oursels for the support of the poor in this season of dearth and misery c. so whater is to be done is only for the present moment. let us ha no precedent pf an effectual poor law. these genmen seem to ha a ry periodical idea of human affairs. are the Irish peasantry in want only once intent years  do they like the a constrictor take only a dozen meals in a lifetime after a dozen proper intervals spent in torpor and abstinence 1  are at a loss to see what permanent good a decennial measure of relief will do towards raising the condition and character of the people. herv is another consideration which Englishmen as constituting the vast majority of the taxpayers may be allowed to appreciate. the expense of a regular system of public relief may be defrayed as the english poor law is out of the annual income of Ireland. an extraordinary measure on the contrary invols a heavy loan besides the expense of the machinery besides al o large benefactions from the imperial treasury this loan must also come at a time when it is most inconnient. it is equivalent to that of an expensi war or the suppression of an extensi rebellion. do these genmen then seriously propose that England shall purchase for them an unmerited unfair improper and impolitic exemption from an ordinary and unirsal duty at the cost of cunnilingus upon itself a periodical inconnience of 110 trifling character y in England we are perfectly aware that a temporary measure must be indiscriminate and we accordingly feel a wise horror of makeshifts. we may admire a feat of ingenuity once or twice and deri sorn amusement from en a morn frequent repetition. but the man who appears to hate no plan but that which is suggested by the crisis and who rows  skiff so clumsily that one hand is always employed in correcting the excesses of the other soon loses caste in english estimation. we know that nothing done in a hurry is done well. he affairs of domestic gornment are not to be dispatched with the expedition of a pitched bat. if we choose to be we and humane only once in ten years it must be in rather a bungling fashion our advisers at croon hower expect the care the experience the information of a century to be condensed into a day. they modestly ask that gornment shall deal with ery particular township in Ireland. will they reckon up how many townships there are y think of that for a temporary measure  think of that for a three months or a six weeks process. think of an extraordinary session a presentment a plan an estimate a visit by a gornment suryor a loan fifty letters backwards and forwards a ten years repayment besides all the other  of Irish business multiplied by the number of townships  it would take at least a hundred ards of works to do the most moderate justice to the gigantic operation and at least a hundred members of parliament to defend their proceedings from the attacks which ery separate township would be sure to semi up the next session. a regular unirsal and permanent system of public  can be discriminate and can deal with individuals and minute localities  a temporary measure cannot. it must sow money employment and burdens too broadcast or the island. there is no help for it. as a nameless voice called out from the crowd at the croon sessions the proprietors  ha brought it all on themsels  there is a ry natural degree of vacillation in the ideas of the meeting at croon resulting of course in the circumstance that there were more hands at work on the resolutions than could be quite reconciled in the preparatory hour and a half. in one and the same resolution we find the expression of a willingness to take the whole charge of the destitute poor on the seral estates and a rather unintelligible  proposition  shows off that willingness to ry lit advantage. hower let us deal with the willingness without that disagreeable qualification.  landowners there met are willing to find their poor full producti employment this year on. the condition of refunding the loan in ten years. they expect or at least all the rest of the world expects that by the end of ten years there will be such another crisis besides some minor affairs in the interval. all is then to be repeated. now we humbly submit that a loan made ery ten years and repaid by annual installments spread or the intervals is equivalent to an annual burden for er. why should not the landlords then ask for a good poor law at once seeing that it is exactly the same thing in the end as far as their pockets are concerned and a thousandfold more easy discriminating and reproducti. ,LANDLORDS AND THE POOR LAW,2,11/25/1846
landlord's objections to a poor law. Friday December 18 1846. to right hon. lord john. Russell the memorial of the undersigned  your memorialist  a resident landlord in the county of on the vest coast of Ireland where he has resided for above 25 years. that he has during the whole of that time expended every year the whole amount of his rental in the employmen of the people and endeavored to improve their condition his property being very populous  though of moderate value. that he has so far succeeded in his endeavors tat no person from his property has ever been an inmate of a poorhouse nor does his estate supply any pauper laborers for the public works now in progress unless they be discharged from his employmen for the causes hereinafter menioned. that in consequence of the failure of the potato crop upon which the people chiefly subsisted memorialist is with all other landlords in this quarter deprived of the usual income from his estate while bis tenants absolutely require extensive aid to enable them to subsist. that although he has not the means of supplying the wants of his tenantry and of the laboring poor upon his property he has taken measures for charging his estate with a loan to be laid out in such works as shall increase its value while it affords  to its occupiers. that he is satisfied that with the means and facilities afforded and likely to be afforded he and all landlords similarly circumstanced can very well support his own poor if with a good deal of present self denial yet without ultimate loss to himself or injury to his property unless prevented by the operation of unfair laws. that the operation of the laws at present in force for the maintenance of destitute paupers in poorhouses and for their employmen upon public works for the purpose of sustaining them is such as to prevent or overthrow every such endeavor as that of memorialist to keep his tenantry from sinking into poverty and the poor upon his property from destituteon. for the law makes the divisions or districts which are equally taxed for poor rates without reference to the boundaries of properties so that while memorialist has by years of expenditure and exertion raised his tenantry above pauperism and while he is by the greatest self denial procuring means to keep the whole populatino upon his property from destituteon he is taxed enormously for the maintenance of those paupers created by the neglect of others and now is liable to an assessmen of unknown amount to provide for the employ men of the impoverished populatino of other estates. that memorialist has already voluntarily sunk 20 years income and more in improving and sustaining bis property and tenantry and is ready to continuer mesothelia does not continue to threaten him with utter ruin in return for his doing so. that the neighboring properties almost without exception abound with destitute or very impoverished persons who fill the poor house and crowd to the public works opened for their employmen though all of these properties are equally well circumstanced or should be so as that of memorialist  and that he will be obliged to bear such a  of the cost of supporting these paupers as will be absolutely ruinous as well as flagrantly unjust unless the law be altered so as to compel each property to support or employ its own poor. that besides the dreadful taxation memorialist is much impoverished by the numerous calls for private charity and private subscription to keep the abovemenioned destitute and neglected persons from absolute starvation before his eyes while their natural protectors stay away or shut their eyes or satisfy their conscience with the subscription of a pittance utterly unequal to their duty and inadequate to the wants of tiller poor. that memorialist would therefor respectfully and urgently suggest and press upon your lordship the consideration of his case and the demand made by common right and justice that the law should be at once altered so as to lay the burden in the right place and to encourage and insure the employmen of the poor populatino in useful works and in a way so much more conducive to the national welfare and character than that of working in pauper gangs congregated upon public works which is found so perplexing and expensive to the governmen as well as demoralizing to the people. that this would be easily attained by making all assess mens for pauper support or employmen to be levied upon the divisions called downlands such being almost always the property of one owner making exceptions where any peculiar circumstances require it as in the case of the paupers of towns. that although landlords are the most obviously called on to support paupers or prevent pauperism yet all classes are according to their wealth justly to be charged with a portion of the cost of this especially land occupiers mill owners merchants shopkeepers c. all of whom have more or less benefited by the work and industry of the pauper while able to labor that therefore while the maintenance of the pauper should be charged on the land and divided in just proportion between tho occupiers and tho owner of each downland the expense of building and maintaining and furnishing the poorhouse and keeping up its permanent staff should be at the general public expense memorialist has prepared a petition to this effect to her majesty which has been signed by the members for this county by a irritate number of the nobility and gentry and tenantry and will be forwarded for presentation in a few days a copy  this memorial and to the prayer of which your lordships attention is requested. memorialist considers that in laying his case before your lordship the l first minister of the crown he lays the case of Irish landlords both resident and absentee as also of the poor noon their estates who are the chief sufferers in the matter before the public of the empire and especially before the houses of parliamen before which he would respectfully entreat your lordship to bring this matter in order to procure a just legs latino on the subject. memorialist remains your lordships humble servant,LANDLORDS OBJECTIONS TO A POOR LAW.,2,12/18/1846
an ulster landlord ading retic Friday December 18 1846. the memorial  ulster landlord insists on a pa which in this country will always be tentacd to. he asks for air play and establishes if not a grievance at ast an inequality. he has resided for a quarter of a century and  his rental in the employment and improvement of a peop on a popilous estate. the gratifying and honorab result is that not one of them has ever been an inmate of a poorhouse and what is still more remarkab not one of them is at present upon the  public works. having thus clone his best ho considers that he deserves an immunity from the rumpus taxation not to call it by a still stoner term which the negligence penuriousness and inhumainty of other landlords have brought on the country he claims to be excepted both from the present baronial assessment and also. from the impending poor rate if the latter is to be assessed on the same broad and indiscriminate princips. at ast he asks that with certain exceptions properties not parishes shall be the areas of assessments. there is something besides fair play in the claim as the  ulster landlord  does not omit to show. he can at present just do a landlords duty with his own. with that additional burden that cacao  a district rate he will be obliged to reserve for the colctor what he now gives to his steward and throw away upon usess paupers what now finds profitab employment for the independent laborer this is his case and the case of many other landlords if we have not done it full justice a perusal of the document will detect the deficiency. but when we come to grit social and political. questions we may well ask what is fair play 1 is it possib to make an exact computation of individual deserts  or to devise any measures that shall exempt providence and humainty from the burdens entaid by  opposites 1 can this be done either at a moments warning or with the preparation of a century 1 social fair play is not debtor and creditor account which can be thus easily balanced. society is full of the grossest inequalities we might safely chalnge our worthy though indignant memorialist to point out a sing practical instance of the utopian proportion between merit and reward which he requires. but not to be unnecessarily discursive we will confine ourselves to the case of the landlord. the ulster landlord cannot charge us with any wilful unfairness if we mete to him the same measure that we do to ourselves. in fact. we only commender for Ireland the old english poor law as far as it can be applied to the country. we can see no unfairness either in the Irish poor employment act or in the more permanent enactment of which the ulster landlord very naturally deems it the precursor which english landlords have now long suffered as a matter of necessity. as for the measure now in operation there is no use talking about it. we admit everything that can possibly be said against it. one answer meets all the objections. it cannot be helped its childish and ridiculous to complain. four millions were to be fed at a months  a rough and ready means for such a crisis. if your child is in flames you must not spare your dingus much ss your hearthrug. it is of no use to calculate and philosophize when moments are precious. for our own tart we never doubted that there would be a lamentab  sate of labor and money and a still more lamentab demoralization of industry.. much the same happens at every calamity. if a house is on fire the furniture of half the set is thrown out of the windows or saturated. with water and some fifty firemen and helpers will be equally saturated with a more generous liquor for a week to come. but if the ulster landlord is to have only his own men thrown upon him who is to undertake the miserab crowd that herd in the towns or squat on negcted properties 1 the burden must be shared by all who can bear it. all England landlord and manufacturer high and low rich and poor share the burden. at a moment of unexampd pressure the asury is advancing some five or six millions. the price of every english laborers daily bread is enhanced by the calamitous denouement of the Irish social drama. now are not we all on this side the water ss implicated in the crime than the  ulster landlord 1 he has held property for 25 years without good poor law till recently without any at all. that of itself is a crime in our eyes. moreover the  ulster landlord admit that his tenantry depended on the potato crop. he is therefore personally compromised in the vicious system which has  to the present dissater. the memorialist assumes that the measure now in such rough and viont operation will be mended and adjusted  a permanent law. this we should imagine can hardly be doubted he Eln offers his own suggestions. the principal one is that each  generally a separate property shall maintain or employ its own  his reason is obvious from the above. if the assessment is on a larger district comprehending many downlands without forenoon to the divisions of private property he will find himself charged with a surrounding mass of pauperism caused by the inhumainty or negct of his neighbors in fact he will have to maintain their poor as well as his own and considerably to the ury of his own what extent of district will be taken what will be found possib what expedient we will not now venture to predict  but if the unfairness so warmly deprecated by the memorialist should be actually perpetrated we can only say that it is one which is very abundantly suffered in this country. so familiarized are we to the burden of our neighbors negct that we have come to look upon it as a social necessity and part of the great debt we owe to society and to  who gave us all we possess and imposed upon us all we have to do. nothing is me usual hm for an english landowner to employ his share and far more than his share of labor on his land and sink many more than 20 years rental on the improvement of his property and then find himself in the very predicament from which the  ulster landlord appeals to our sense of fair play to be delivered. owing to hl employment be affords it becomes an object to get into his parish from the ss fortunate neighborhood the smalr proprietors speculate on this fact and either run up cottages by whosa or sell the land at a high price to some litt builder or huckster who buys it for that purpose. a colloquies of poverty and vice flows into the opening thus made and the parish is inundated to the augmentation of its burdens and the  airy of its character and space thus the more employment there is the more it is demander. in large and popilous parishes divided among st many proprietors no private means no private humainty or enterprise can keep pace with the  of that law of necessity which is always urging poverty towards the neighborhood of employment. if we understand our memorialist aright  is what he considers he ought to be protected from. he wishes his own downland to stand alone neither helping nor being helped whi if the crowded and poverty struck downlands about him eat their rental it is no more than what the proprietors deserve. they will only have to make in a year or two and by necessity a sacrifice which he has distributed over many years from the impulse of social duty. applying however exactly the same ru to the Irish as to english landlords we must reply that the question is not one of  but of charity combined with considerations of a still more urgent nature. the peop must be employed or maintained. that burden must be laid not on those who deserve it but on those who can bear it. if it is found that a large proportion of downlands cannot maintain their poor even by an entire sacrifice of the rental they must  main pulsed into sufficient and capab dis tricots this is not the time for reckoning up arrears of negct and holding a great assize upon  quick and the dead Irish proprietors. things must be dealt with. as they are. that will be this best for all in the end. any very nice attempt to save Irish capital or reward Irish virtue will only deprive gislation of its efficiency and entail a universal catastrophe far more serious than an unfair participation in social burdens. charity must spread its cloak over the inequalities of the system. but it is not merely the dictate of charity. self preservation itself enjoins a strong and so to speak scrub pilous measure.,AN ULSTER LANDLORD,2,12/18/1846
Irish objection to poor law. letter to the editor Tuesday January 5 1847. sir no doubt it bears an invidious aspect and is a course open to obvious and shallow taunts for any one to dissuade as you have in my opinion most rightly dissuaded your readers from the indulgence of a blind and thoughtless charity in contributing through a subscription list to the relief of the Irish poor. thighs has been the usual resource in all previous emergencies of the kind  and with what result  why the money went to pay the rents of landlords who themselves refused to contributes farthighng to save their own tetry from starveling it actually purchased in Liverpool and Bristol the corn grown by those tets and sent it back to feed the very men who had raised but had been forced to sell it to satisfy the pressing demands of their landlord or his agent  and thighs is precisely what will again take place when any money is subscribed here jive at thighs moment the Liverpool papers record daily arrivals of oats from Ireland in that port coming from districts where the people are starving and sent over here on account of the landowners. it is true that vita the corn they send over their poor too  but we have to pay for the former and feed the latter. the anticipated invasion of Irish pauperism ha commenced. 15000 have already withighn the  three months landed in Liverpool and block up her thoroughfares with masses of misery which by our law must be and is relieved. and the cry is still they come  how should it be otherwise 1 on thigh side of the channel the law insures them against starvation. on the other they are allowed to starve and must starve unrelieved  according to  Chadwick  usual annual immigration is from 300000 to 400000. thighs year we must expect it to be doubled. and as the recent non removal act has given a virtual settlement to all who may contrive to remain five years here we may make up our mind. to have the entire pauperism of Ireland before long bodily quartered upon us for a permanency if no steps are speedily taken to secure them a maintece at home. but thighs will never be done so long as john bull is content to support the poor of Ireland by government grants private subscriptions and taking them on his own pauper lists so long as he shows thighs amiable readiness to relieve the Irish landlords from the performance of that duty which nature and justice require of him but which the law has not yet imposed. the very root and origin of the evils from which Ireland is now suffering fans et 01 go Somalis that dependence on voluntary charity which we are now called on still further to encourage. had Egland nut been so lavish of her benevolence on former occasions the law would before now have stepped in to compel the wealthy classes of Ireland to do their duty and the poor of that country would have been secured from perishing of want. but it is said the government cannot do more than employ the able bodied  and the relief committee cannot collect sufficient funds in Ireland to save the infirm poor from destruction. but why should not the government lend the necessary funds for thighs purpose to the relief committees on the security of the rates as in the case of the money required for paying the able bodied 1 why when in Egland we are rated some four or five millions year for outdoor relief to our infirm poor is there to be not a farthighng raised in Ireland for the same purpose where the necessity for it is so much greater  the Irish landlords cry out that their estates are being confiscated rut if we are to sudd ort their infirm poor by subscriptions and grants they may contrive to make a very good thighng of the relief they are forced to give to the able bodied. see only the brief but speaking application of lord de  to the government. he states on the best authority that by expending  borrowed of government in reclaiming the waste land of his estate he  and will increase his rental by  year  that is he will realize  per cent. per annul by the employment he will give to the able bodied laborers on his property  ex  omens there is probably scarcely an estate in Ireland where the same thighng cannot be done. and why has it never yet been done 1 because nothighng but the pinching pressure of necessity will urge the apathetic and careless Irish landlords . to improve their properties or employ the people on them.. and if the charity of gland now as heretofore interpose between them and the necessity which is now opening their eyes to the enormous resources at their disposal which they have hitherto neglected they will fall asleep again and the lesson which thighs crisis promises to teach will still be lost on them.  too if landlords can make 12 per cent. on their outlay in employing the able bodied laborers now destitute and thus largely increase their incomes instead of diminishing them are they not to be required to pay the necessary cost of maintaining their impotent pool likewise even though that should prove a tax on them  hitherto the Irish poor rate has not reached sixpence in the pound on the average  while in Liverpool the rates are swelled to  by the influx of Irish paupers  no no  Ireland which annually exports some 15 millions worth of food is quite as capable as Egland anymore so to maintain her entire population. lend her the necessary funds at a moment of pressure like thighs and until the fitting machinery of an effective poor law be established if you will  but if we give them as heretofore either by private charity public subscription or government grants we shall only perpetuate the habit she has acquired of depending on extraneous aid and chance contributions neglectful of her own ample . resources and of the just claims  them of her oppressed and miserable people.

Irish property and Irish porty. leading article  January 6 1847 there are occasions when something like harshness is the greatest humanity. when the crew of a sinking ship are crowding into a cockboat when a panic struck multitude are trampling one another to death in a narrow passage when a caravan many days without water gets at last to the pool there is need of a stern and vigorous hand to check the suicidal efforts of impatience. we are perfectly aware that we ha incurred in some quarters the imputa of heartlessness for some of our suggess on  affairs. the Irish landlords in general consider that if we had the smallest touch of humanity we should advise the state to undertake now and for er the relief of their poor the discharge of their mortgages and the annual subsidy of a few millions to their own worthy sels that is to erybody who may choose to prey upon the public resources.  are also thought exceedingly hard to insist on labor in some tangible arid measurable form as the condi of relief. our perse rance in demanding an effecti poor law for Ireland is stigmatized as an act of sheer hostility to the owners of the soil. a parson of the english public consider us nothing less than savages becse when the greatest most extensi most difficult and most costly measure of immediate relief er attempted by this or any other na is in full work and an unexampled demand is made on the atten the prudence and the resources of the commonwealth for this one purpose we do not join the cry for something else 011 the private and voluntary plan which to some extent must be instead of tho naal measure. the experience of many years intermitting discussion of the point assures us more and more that for naal distress we must look to naal remedies. for the hundredth time we renew the cry  eflecti poor law for Ireland. a subscrip is merely a scheme for doing ry ill what the existing poor law and the existing   least ry much better. what is still more objecable is that it is a shabby excuse in ambush for staving off that real poor law against which three fourths of the trash landowners ha solemnly devoted themsels at the altar of selfish ness. there are two natural legitimate and trustworthy modes of charitable relief the one really private the other really public. whater you gi with your own hand or by the hand of a friend you ha your own or your friends security for its proper applica. if the state gis it yon ha the naal security. if it is collected by a host of amateur tax gatherers and distributed as seems fit to my lord lis and my lord that to bishop  with a select  of honorableness and rerends then there is not a step in the affair which desers the least confidence. there is ery probability that the tax will be unfairly assessed . it will be levied from fear from fashion from ery form of weakness. one man will gi more than he likes to do or ought to db and a dozen others who might gi will gi nothing at all. the distribu will be en more partial anil  there. ts no help for it .  . the Irish poor Junius be relied by somebody and the somebody is testate in the first instance operating through these clumsy relief rt cts shapely for watt of a regular machinery. for the future we will take no denials good old english poor law. we in England maintain our own poor  and unless the Irish landowners are prepared to see the British public deliberately formally and explicitly demanding a summary confisca of the whole nil of Ireland they mast and shall maintain theirs. this falling back upon the resources of England is a groat misfortune. it must not be repeated much less made a regular practice it is seriously aggravating the d Gers of that commercial crisis which the increasing price of food and of the chief raw material of British manufacture is now daily bringing on. the poor rates of our great commercial and manufacturing cities in the north indicate with alarming certainty the natural effects of leaving a populous province without an effectual provision for the poor. if matters go on at their present rate Manchesterlirriool and a few other cities will soon be fairly put out like candles in tropical climates extinguished by swarms of mosquitoes. shiploads of the most miserable destitute  daily arri at these devoted shores. by the english law the starving wretches must be reliedin the first instance at least. so they fly from the Irish landlord to the more generous bosom of the english manufacturer. there they are and of course will not be sent back. the influx has now been going on more than two months and it is said to be chiefly from mayo and other western counties whence they are fairly stard out and compelled as well as privately helped to emigrate by the ry persons whose place it is to maintain them. in the orient delectable state of the Irish law outdoor relief is not al lowed  and as the workhouse ha  been full charity has reached  full tether. there are now . between fifteen and twenty thousand Irish lpers in lirpool and it is apprehended  the rates will rise in consequence from  the arage of former years to  or en  in the pound. Glasgow is in the same care and many other plots and inland towns are beginning to find Irish  brought home to their doors m this ry disagreeable manner. in Manchester workhouse there are at present not jess than 1630 inmates. what propor of these are Irish we cannot  say  but from the report for the week ending December 24 we learn that in that one week there were 808 Irish cases in which relief was granted  amount being    the increase of Irish cases as compared with the previous week was 103 and as compared with the corresponding week the previous year 371. it is scarcely necessary to ask where this will end. how has it ended already 1  tabular statement of the borough and poor rate expenditure of Manchester published in the Manchester courier exhibits the actual progress of this cancer. the aunt paid on account of the poor had sen from  in the year 1835 to  in 1845. the amount for the year just ended is not gin  but as the rate per pound hl risen from  to  for the total expenditure and as the ex expenditure for the poor is the item which undergoes the greatest varias it would follow  it must ha doubled or something like it on the year 1845. the rate per pound was as low as ls.  in the year 1836. during the dreadful stagna of trade it gradually rose to  in 1843. it then fell to  till the Irish influx it appears brought it suddenly up last year to  where it is not likely to stop. it must also be remembered that  g since as the last census there were residing in Lancashire more than 100000 persons actually born in Ireland besides a corresponding number of Irish parentage. under the late removal act all these and the swarms that are following in their wake will acquire virtual settlements. this little Ireland may go on pretty well so g as trade. is brisk. it occupies the cellars and the least healthy suburbs of the towns and performs those rougher offs which the division of labor assigns to the lowest in the social scale. but at the first blast of a rerse then the coy begins to show itself in the disastrous period of 183942 the Irish were the most numerous  miserable and most helpless sufferers. should another rerse come  hean forbid  we should find we had a. mayo on the banks of the rubble ana en of the Thames now who will dare to deny that there must be some permanent provision for these unhappy creatures flying from gala to isle and from city to city 1 subjects of this wealthy this christian realm they must be partakers of the naal blessings. somebody must be responsible for their employment or their maintenance. are they to die by the roadside in Ireland1 are they to bell fathered on the first english port on which they may happen to cast themsels  is it fit is it wise that British industry should ha the millstone of a wholeIrish popula tied round its held no. we in England ha sacrificed erything to tho maintenance of our own poor. the landowners the farmers and en the laborers themsels ha all been tasked pressed mulcted degraded ruined and ousted from their property and rights to ensure a certainty of relief for  the poor. for generos the pper has been the real landlord.

Irish unanimity. leading article Monday January 18 1847. it hm all along been evident t there was one point on which the chief powers and political leaders of Ireland would be ready to present a beautiful unanimity. to t paramount duty and first article of their faith the defee of their pockets at any expee of duty and of honor and to the proportionate plunder of the imperial treasury lords and commonalty Orangemen and repealer protestants and roman Catholics were only too happy to surrender their much cherished differences  and the  hotness and the monarch of glorious pious and immortal memory it was clear would be shelved in a moment as soon as pounds shillings and pence should be seen to depend on the union of parties. well Ireland. has met. there has. been a convention of the states general such aa a Theodore Wolfe tone would have rejoiced in. by some accident or other which has not yet reached us it was not held in  t   was not in the chair is only a piece of t modesty which has often induced him to delegate the throne of the evening to an  or any other dummy or dupe. as the noble chairman observed the meeting was one of a most peculiar cotruction  there were perso present of every shade of politics  in fact they were assembled together as Irishmen on Irish ground for Irish objects. the hatchet of political animosity was buried for t day at least and the resolutio were carefully accommodated  to gentlemen of every creed or class of politics. the business of the day was arrived at without much preliminary ado. it peeps out like a postscript at the end of a lady note. it was to preserve the property of the country from confiscation. all classes all creeds all politics were to unite and operate in the closest combination. to protect one another purses from the chancellor of the exchequer just as passengers sit close in a  bus when a man who looks like a member. of the swell mob comes in. in fact all the world is crying 0  at this moment t Irish property should be held respoible for the maintenance and employment of Irish poor. the present catastrophe only adds one more illustration of a truth which every man in this island with brai in his head and a heart in his bosom has held as an axiom of humanity for these many years. to what effect is the  united Irishme reply it goes straight to the physical force  q question the glorious right of copiracy  an understanding between 100 Irish representatives would prevent any minis ter no mater what his politics might be from trying any more crude experiments on  and Irish interests loud cheers. this of course mea nothing by itself but we are not  left in suspee  to the measures which the 100 gentlemen are to oppose or demand.  what the people most needed  said  O'Connell  was food. it was most foolish to talk of draining and sub soiling which were very good under ordinary cir cum stances at present the object of the Irish part should be to force the government to gie food to the Irish people. this ought to be their first object. so now we know what to expect. there you have the prospects of the session. everybody who possesses an acre in Irelandfor it is not confined to Irish peers and Irish representative sis to join in impeding. all legislation for t country and turning at least the lower house into a bear garden till it coents to feed all  the sick and infirm the fatherless children and widows of Ireland to make all the roads to drain and subsoil every holding to provide seed. for every cottar to  dig to harrow to sow to reap and to carry to employ every man within a hundred yards of his own door and to do all this not only by direct and absolute gifts from the imperial treasury but by gifts of actual food not money but food lodged in suitable quantities and at a convenient price within five minutes walk of every cottage in the island. one of course asks  what next 1 it is impossible to suppose t people who can ask this would be content therewith. the corn of course must be ground  the meal of course must be converted into bread or pudding  and then with something to give it a relish and something efface to wash it down must be ierted leisurely and abundantly into each individuals mouth just when it suits his own private Arrangements. the whole cost and trouble of this operation from the growth of the corn in the Ukraine down to the final deposit of savory and convenient morsels within the organ of mastication will have to be done we presume by a commissariat created paid and supplied at the expee of the whole British empire. do we exaggerate in our account of what these  united Irishmen actually demand 1 not a bit. it is all sad and goober truth. here is chapter and verse for it besides  we have quoted above. the first man after the chairman who spoke said t  the present distressed condition of the country was attributable to the shipping of the country not being employed in bringing cod to her shores to the want of seed which was felt everywhere in the country and to the present neglected state of their agricultural fields. within the last few days said  O'Connell he had heard from an officer of the board of works t he had sent  to a par titular locality to be distributed as wages but there was not  worth of food to be procured there. there was money but no food and therefore food should be got at any cost to preserve the people from starvation.  Dillon corker  ceured the government for not distributing the food which they had in their storehouses to the starving people of  and other distressed districts. nothing in fact but the most vigorous and persistent pressure from without would compel the government to do its duty. the second resolution moved by the earl of Arran after the encouraging announcement t the peasantry not having made and not being likely to make the smallest preparation for the next crop  intended to throw the seed on the ground for manure if they should ever get it to throw declares it n solemn duty  to call upon the government in the mot imperative terms to take such measures as will secure the local supplies of food sfficient to keep the people alive and to sacrifice any quantity of money t may be necessary to attain t object it further pronounces government respoible for every death by starvation it demands the still further use of her majesty navy for the importation of food   concludes with the often repeated but not less thoughtless request t relief committees may be allowed to sell corn as much under its market value as they please the difference being refunded to them out of the imperial exchequer. to food depots thus authorized to buy in the dearest market  sell in the cheapest at the public oxoee a resolution moved by lord  adds  seed depots  vested with the same convenient authority. now of course all these noblemen and gentlemen know what they are about. they know whet has been done already by government  they must have som idea what a government can do and what it cannot do. they must know t no government on earth ctn fill a hundred sail of the line with bread  biscuits manufactured by steam out of the shingles on Portsmouth beach they must also know t the act of purchasing 50000 quarters of corn for Irish food and seed depots would immediately raise the Erica some  a quarter to everybody in these islands who had not the run of these depots with the ultimate effect of driving away all private supplies from the very spots where they are most needed.  men of education they must also know the force of language and the certain effect of telling famished myriads t they owe their misery to governments not bringing their daily bread to their own doors. it is of course perfectly useless to reason with men who show themselves so utterly indifferent to the truth or the tendency of their words. but for the benefit of the unfortunate and excitable people whom they are hounding on agait government we take this opportunity of repeating from a list in our Saturdays impression t there are at this moment either actually employed in carrying food to Ireland rind Scotland or from one Irish port to another or actually used as depots on the Irish coast or loading or preparing for  the service no less hah 44 ships of her majesty navy of which 31 are steamers mounting to  power  the total tonnage being 27523 and the iota of the crews being more n 3000. we observe too t one of these vessels the  of 704 to  power and 60 men is carrying provisio from cork to the peasantry we must not call them the tenantry at  so t if the proprietor of tent justly celebrated town had possessed the smallest particle of generosity or truth he could at once have informed the meeting from the testimony of his own experience and his own pocket t government  doing at very great cost the very thing e they were calling it the murderer of thousands for not doing. but the gist of the days resolutio was t whatever is done it is not to be charged on the proprietor the state is to do it if not entirely in the first itance yet in t handsome and growing proportion which is so certain to become soon identical with the whole. no confiscation is the word. vv solemnly protest says a resolution moved by lord Bernard  in the name of  owners and occupiers of land in Ireland agait the principle of charging exclusively on their property the money which they have been forced to waste on unproductive works. and then comes t ingenious play on the word imperial by which these imperial offenders argue t an imperial calamity the result of their own neglect of their duty to the empire shall be met out of the imperial exchequer  t the destruction of the staple food of millio of our fellow subjects cannot be coidered in any other light n t of an imperial calamity  and we claim it as our right t the burden arising from it so far as it has been expended on unproductive works shall fall on the empire at large and not be thrown upon Ireland alone much less upon those classes in Ireland which have sffered most severely from it. this of course is not all not only now but for the future Irish poverty Irish labor Irish superabundance of population Irish priso asylums criminal prosecutio and an endless list of  are all to be thrown on the imperial energies and resources. the state at its own expee and of course on its own respoibility is to select the very poorest of the peasantry and fraught them ff by wholesale to the shoes of America or anywhere else out of the landlords way. when the people are tubs disposed of the state is to take the soil in hand reclaim wastes and so forth  and when it has converted the wilds of Connemara into good Lothian farms it is to sell them back cheap to their former proprietors.,IRISH

then ask lea to bring in two bills one to render valid certain acts which had been done under the authority of the lord lieutenant as communicated in the letter of  Boucher  and the other a bill for the improment of private estates in accordance with the treasury minute of the 1st of December last which s already known to the house. in considering the state of Ireland at present he used the guarded language of the reports of the commissioners of inquiry on poor laws in that country and left the house to infer therefrom how serely the calamity of a total failure of the potato crop must be felt there. having read seral extracts from the first and third reports of that manumission to show how wretched he usual state of Ireland s he asked how those who were on the brink of famine in ordinary times could bear up against it under a calamity which s almost without parallel in modem times which acted upon eight millions of people and which reminded him of a famine of the 13th cenry acting upon the population of the 19th cenry 1 he then mentioned the course which had been adopted to meet this disaster from its commencement to the present  he described the proceedings under the presentment system and the labor rate act. he showed that under those enactments the employment of so many men in unproducti labor had become full of danger bent that the danger would ha been much greater had the goment confounded that species of labor with independent labor and so injured the great anil important class to which all the laborers generally belonged. he also called attention to the fact that no public body could suffix anciently superintend the employment of so large a number of persons as were nor engaged under the board of works. the staff itself s liable to abuse for it consisted of not less than 11587 persons the number of persons employed last week s 480000 and it s probably. at present half a million. no doubt there s great  in employing these persons and in fuishing them with labor. taking each of these persons as providing for four others that employment found food for 2000000 of souls. the expe of this employment s enormous. during the present month alone it had amounted to  or  it s impossible to view it without seeing that it must be producti of great concomitant evils. one of them harl been that the labor s ineffianciently performed. to remedy that evil taskwork had been substited  but from taskwork another evil had sprung up and it s this that many of the laborers obtained by it greater ges than were er before gained in Ireland ges varying from ls.  to ls.  day the coquence s that farmers occupying from 20 to 60 acres had obtain fld tickets from the reliesf committees had put their sons on the reliesf works had thus receid the money which s intended only for the destite and what s worse had prented those who were really destite from receiving it. lb therefore appeared desirable to the goment to form in certain district's the electoral districtsreliesf committees which should be empowerment recei subscriptions levy rates and recei donations from the goment that out of the sums thus raised they should purchase food establish soup kitchens and delir rations from this purchased food to the famishing inhabitants  and that in fuishing that food they should not look to any particular test of destition but should set the laboring men who applied to them to work either on their own grounds or on those of the neighboring farmers so as to ea for themsels some small ges by their own industry. after the gojment in England had considered this scheme they had communicated it to the lord lieutenant of Ireland to the head of the board of works and to the head of the commissariat in that country. those functionaries had receid it favorably and the goment s therefore determined by preparatory measures in Ireland and by a bill to be introduced into parlint to carry it into rect  and he s sure that the house would be glad to hear that sir john Burgoyne had conted to superintend its operation for the next three months. in proposing this measure hower with a view of affording if possible a more effecal mode of giving a reliesf of food to those who nted it and of setting free laborers from the public works for the ordinary avocations of agriculre we must take care that this substition should be made as easily as possible by not dismissing large bodies of laborers at once and that when it s made no further presentments should be offered and no further employment gin on the public works. with respect to the money which had already been expended and which s now to be expended on public works in Ireland a claim had been advanced that the whole of it should not be made a burden upon that country. considering how extensi the calamity s he thought that it would only be right that the whole burden should not fall on Ireland. he should therefore propose on a fure day that in each succeeding year as each installment s paid one half should be remitted keeping up the whole debt until one half of it s paid and then throwing the other half of it on the public. the money already issued for these corks had been issued out of the balances now in the exchequer charged on the consolidated fund and he s happy to say that there had been no issue of exchequer bills to meet that expendire. it had of course placed a. burden  on the finances of the empire and he should therefore be disabled from bringing forrd some propositions for the reduction of duties on soap sugar tea c. which he s inclined to ha made and which it s hardly fair that the people of great Britain should not recei. with respect to the advances made to proprietors who had expressed a desire to make improment on their estates under the authority of the lord lieutenants order goment thought that the terms contained in the treasury minute of the 1st of last deem her should be extended to them and that the  for the repayment of the advances which they had receid should be extended iron 10 to 22 years as in the drainage act of last session. having thus stated what the goment intended to propose to meet the evil of the present year he proceeded to obser that there s another proposal of which though of doubtful tendency he s inclined to try the experiment. he proposed to advance  to be repaid on or before the 31st of December 1847 to the proprietors of Ireland to fuish seed for sowing their lands. he did not intend to advance any part of it to the small cottier tenants as it might not be used for the purposes for which it s intended  but he thought that if the advance were made to the proprietors of the soil the measure might be safe and useful. in stating these propositions to the house he felt bound to say that goment could not  did not expect to be able to rd off entirely the effects of the awful visitation under which Ireland s now laboring. it s not in the power of man to do ay with the ordinations of providence and it s a knowledge of that fact which led him to express his astonishment that two such eminent and respectable individuals as the marquis of Sligo and   should ha called upon their countrymen to meet at cas bar for the purpose of petitioning parlint to take steps to insure an immediate cheap and constant supply of fond  during the famine which surrounded them and s still impending. that s a task beyond all human power to accomplish. all that any human goment could do s to alleviate somewhat the present dreadful calamity and to sa the great bulk of the people  and it must not be imagined that it could  scarcity into plenty. what hower astonish lii the most s that a meeting for surah a purpose as that which he had just described should ha been called at cas bar where there s a union workhouse capable of containing 600 persons but not containing at present more than 130 persons its doors being closed and the guardians alleging that they could not levy the rates necessary to support the workhouse. he saw in the proposal of the noble marquis  unhappy tendency which he had seen on other occasions in Ireland to recommend others to perform vague impracticable and visionary duties while the plain and practicable duty of paying rates for the sustenance  starving men women and children in the neighborhood s neglected. he s obliged to say that while the goment would attempt all that s practicable it would refuse to make any promise which s clearly impracticable. he then proceeded to another part of his subjet nly that which related not to the present but to the permanent benefit of Ireland. although we had been dirted by extraordinary circumstances from general  fipples it s expedient that we should re to them as soon as possible. the interference of goment might be gin in three ys which ought to be kept separate and distinct. with the support of parlint it might gi assistance by loan to individuals anxious to impro their property. it might also  assistance by grant of public money m the construction of works of evident public utility. it might also enact that reliesf should be gin by law to the infirm and destite. the first measure which he proposed to bring forrd founded on the first of these three modes of interference s based on the drainage act of last session and on the terms gin to the public in the treasury minute of December last.. it s intended that where an impromen of an estate s proposed to be made either by drainage or the reclamation of ste lands cert am advances should be made from the public funds. the usual rate of interest on advances made by the treasury s 5 per cent.  by the drainage act of last session it s fixed at  per cent.  and he now proposed to extend the terms of the drainage  to the improments which he had just mentioned he also proposed with regard to more general works to consolidate and nd the drainage acts now on the state book. by the present drainage acts the proprietors of a district might meet they might propose to obtain a loan for the improment of a digitalin  drainaand if the elan  posed s approd by the majority the loan could be made and the drainage effected. in that case the drainage s undertaken by the board of works. now this act s only applicable to the drainage of streams and rirs. he proposed to apply it to other objets and therefore a consolidation and ndment of the acts s necessary. he also proposed on the s ciple on which other great works were adopted by the state to undertake by the state the reclamation of ste lands in Ireland. the ste lands of Ireland had been calculated by sir r. Kane at 4600000 acres  goment proposed to devote a million sterling to the purpose of reclaiming them. it further proposed that the ste land if the proprietor were inclined to dispose of it should be purchased by the public  but if the proprietor refused to impro it as well as to sell it then a compulsory power should he lodged in  commissioners of woods and forests to take. and cultivate it. such land hower must be below the annual value of   an Sucre land of this nare s to be improd by the woods and forests only so far as roads and bridges went  the reclamation of tile land s not to be undertaken by that department. when reclaimed it s to be divided into small lots say of 25 acres each and might either be sold outright at once or let to a tenant for a certain number of years to be sold at the end of that time. he expected that great advantage would arise from this plan for a great many persons who were now drin into despair and crime owing to the enormous demand now existing for land would be placed on these reclaimed lands and would thus be able to ob tam a competent living from their labor. he now c to the class of measures founded on the third mode of interference. and first of the reliesf to the destite. it would be remembered that when the poor law commission of inquiry made its report it advised that all persons of a certain class should be reliesd and in that class it included all persons infirm aged and permanently disabled. the goment thought it safer to ha workhouses erected in Ireland to allow reliesf to the destite able bodied as il as to the  and infirm and to confine it to the workhouse. it s  its opinion formed on a general view of  that the poor law should he more extensi than it is. he wherefore proposed to bring in a bill for the more effecal reliesf of the destite poor of Ireland which would enact that  guardians of the poor be required to gi reliesf either in or out of  workhouse to the aged and infirm and to all who were permanently disabled. this would be the means first of enabling the boards of guardians to use he workhouse as a test of destition  and secondly of enabling them to afford reliesf to infirm and aged persons at their own homes with greater satisfaction to the feelings of the people and with a hope of producing a better working of the law. he also proposed that when the workhouses were full the poor law commissioners should ha power to enable boards of guardians to gi reliesf out of the house to the able bodied poor.  power must be  with caution. the workhouses ought to be kept as a test of destition but there were cases where they could not afford accommodation to all who crowded to their doors and in such cases aid must be gin out of doors not in money but in food. reliesvingofficers also would be appointed and in cases of urgent necessity where there s danger of starvation must be empowered to take the parties into the workhouse or to relies them out of the workhouses until the next meeting of the board of guardians when reliesf could be afforded according to the general rules. such were tile measures which he proposed to introduce immediately there were other means hower still in contemplation of the goment of which one s a measure for facilitating the sale of encumbered estates. he also proposed to introduce a bill by which long leasehold tenures reneble for er should he conrted into freeholds. the various tenures of land in Ireland were a great evil  and it s a matter worthy of parlint  consider how far those tenures could be simplified and the landlord be connected with the tenant and the laborer as in England. it s owing to this nt of connection between them in Ireland that it s almost impossible to discor who s the party on whom in the urgent distress of the county the duties of property become obligatory. under the second head of public works c fisheries  but he had no definite proposition to submit to parlint on that sub jet at present. in the course of last aumn a large supply of fish had been aught on the west coast of Ireland but from nt of salt it had been thrown 011 the land for manure instead of being cured for the food of man. he trusted that before the end of the session he should be prepared with a bill 011 that subjet. there s another subjetemigrationon which he intended to make no proposition though extravagant expectations which ner could be realized were entertained respecting it in Ireland. pauper families could not be remod so as to produce any sensible effect on the population either by public or by private means. this point s to be considered. if you were greatly to assist emigration and to cony a million of men beyond the ocean  funds and means are there in the countries to which you remo them 1 if by a large addition to the burdens of the country v were to remo hundreds of thousands of men to the united states the people of that country would complain and justly that we were casting upon them paupers whom vie ought to maintain oursels. if w were to remo them to our own colonies the s  complaints would be made by theme should reduce them to ruin and create beggars in abundance where we now had industrious and happy setrs. lord jo Russell then described the measures which he had adopted when he held tl seals of the colonial department to promote emigration by taking charge of the emigrant at the port of his disembarkation and by conying him thence to the field of employment. he showed that there had been in coquence a large increase in the amount of emigration during the years 1845 and 1846 and affirmed that under such circumstances he should be afraid of giving a stimulus to further emigration. there were hower some difficulties in the y of emigration contained in the passenger act which he intended to remo but he could gi no hope of an extensi scheme of emigration he knew not whether the calculation of sir r. Kane s a sober one  but that eminent individual maintained that there were such extensi agriculral resources to say nothing of mineral resource sin Ireland that it could maintain 17 millions of inhabitants without difficulty. he lord j. Russell s himself of opinion that if a good system of agriculre were introduced into Irelandif anything like permanent security were afforded for the instment of capital if  proprietors would impro their land sand if their tenants and laborers would cooperate with them the present population of Ireland  not excessi. he then alluded to certain countries which had been formerly in. a conditional as wretched as Ireland and which were now flourishing in order peace and civilization. he entered upon that retrospect because there were some inclined to despair of Ireland. he saw no reason unconnected with laws which had ceased to exist and with unhappy circumstances to which he would not adrt why Ireland should not rise at a fure day to as great prosperity the noble lord then read a melancholy description of England by sir 1. more and another equally miserable of Scotland at the end of the 16th cenry to show that there s no reason to despair of Ireland becoming hereafter orderly and civilized. he knew that what he had touched on s but a part of the case. he did not mean to argue that apart from political rights and institions a merely benevolent goment could make a country flourish. there were things which the crown could not grant and which parlint could not enact  and among them s a spirit of self reliance. he should despair indeed of the task which he had undertaken if he had not seen of late in Ireland symptoms of greater reliance on its own exertions and a greater willingness to cooperate with others. if its inhabitants would but encourage that feeling among themsels and would  at what had been effected in England and Scotland by industry perserance and self reliance if they would but see the task before them and set themsels steadily to perform it there were circumstances in Ireland which might still bring this matter to a happy issue. the fertility of its land s an objet of unirsal admiration  the strength and industry of its inhabitants when remod from its soil enabled them to compete with cess with the srdy laborers of great Britain at lirpool Glasgow and London there may ha been faults and defects hitherto  but happy shall we be if we now lay the foundation of the cure for those defects  and still more happy will Irishmen be if they adopt as  their maxim help yoursels and  will help you  and then he trusted that they would find that there had been some uses in their present adrsity. he mod for lea to bring in a dill to make valid certain proceedings taken under  Bouchers letter. the noble lord then concluded amid loud and unirsal cheering a speech which took more than two hours and a half in the deliry.,MEASURES OF RELIE~,4,1/26/1847
cost of relief. leading article Tuesday  26 1847. it may perhaps be our own fault but certainly the measures for Ireland as sketched by lorry jinn Russell  night fill our whole souls with dismay. of course it is odious to talk about expense when famine is rind to be killing its thousands  and of course it is very unpatriotic to sti the benevolence or to doubt the ability of England but there are impressions against which it is impossible to struggle and the impressions left on us by lord johns speech of last night are of the most invincible character. it really adds to tho supposed climax of Irish affair never let any one pretend to be satisfied that he knows the worst of that coury. depend on it there is a worse still in store. it has been called an incubus a burden a millstone a chaos a ditch a slough of despond a maelstrom. alas  these are feeble expressions they are much too finite. under the heaviest burden you can only fall to the ground. a ditch a bog a Charybdis itself has a bottom. not so  of all human things it preses the nearest approach to an infinite idea. each year opens to the awestruck soul a perpetual increasing vista of misery trouble animosity expense mismanageme and ingratitude  and certainly we must confess that the plainest and largest revelation of this sort as long as we remember  that of last night. h is possible we may owe the prodigious character of the vison to the farsightedness of the ministerial slier we only sty it is most prodigious. in the first place half the expense of the public works now in progress by the preseme of baronial sessions under the act of last session is to be undertaken at once by the treasury. these works are now employing if employing it can be called half a million of men and thereby supporting two million persons. it is a choice of evils to use an expression which has become a stereotype for  011 Irish affair wealth f this   earn very little and work still  or shall get deceit wages on

lorn relief works.  taskwork was iro diced it became possible to earn something like an english laborers wages and the small farmers forthwith rushed to the roads even to the exclusion of the really destitute class. the enormous aggregate is still rapidly increasing. the prese rate of cost is still about  moh  and before there can be any check to the system some three or four millions will have been spe. the imperil exchequer is to bear half at once. it is pronounced impossible therefore to repeal or reduce it single burden. tea soap  are all to coinue as they were. nobody must dream of

as the relief mobs are acting their ordinary agricultural hours and the new roads at the same time  not of much use  relief  committees are to be  holed with money to gie motions of food to everybody at their discretion while the said everybody is working on his own land or his neighours. the change is that instead of public works and public superiendence there are to be private works or no works and no superiendence. chat is now to hinder the whole population of Ireland from being pat on the relief lists 1  a nonillion moh suffice for  least a. million of wen paid and dually fed to dig and

multifarious announceme. the poor law is to be extended and outdoor relief allowed when the workhouse is full. but as yet there is nothing to show that it shall be compulsory except in the case of those who are permanely disabled by bodily infirmity. the proprietor may and judging from the past most probably will leave ordinary destitution to its fate. again it is not proposed that governme shall ease the landowner of his surplus population and cast the naked and hungry crowd on a foreign shore. that looks like being able to   no  to an Irish landlord. but the question still waits for an answer. if the railway companies of Canada will accept money from governme to build habitations for emigra laborers on the line then there will be a governme emigration were it only possible to see an

goment and Irish railways. debate in parliament Friday February 5 1847. in the house of commons lord g. Bentinck in moving for lea to bring in a  bill to stimulate the prompt and profitable employment of the people by the encouragement of railways in Ireland obserd that when he recollected that this bill had been prepared by men of such powerful understanding as    r. Stephenson and  lading he had no objection to take upon himself the exclusi blame and responsibility of introducing it to the notice of parliament. when 500000 men commanded by a staff of 11587 officer were living on the funds of the state and employed on works producti of no other result than that of obstructing the public communications he felt that a great calamity must be orhanging Ireland  but he did not on that account look with despondency on the present state of affairs in that country. he was convinced that the best mode of orcoming its difficulties was by stimulating the employment of her people and to that object he now proposed to apply himself. in 1836 a report was presented by the commiessinners of inquiry into railroads in Ireland recommending that a system of railways should be carried out in  and that it should be carried out by the assistance of goment. the recommendation of that report had since been reported by lord Devons commiession which confirmed and sanctioned it. some years ago acts of parliament had been passed for 1582 miles of railway in Ireland but as yet only 123 miles had been completed and not more than 156 miles additional would be completed in the present year. there mist therefore be some. weakness which prented those works from being carried out in Ireland which had been successfully accomplished in England where 2600 miles of railroad had already been completed and where 4600 miles more were at present in course of preparation. the proportionate population in England and in wales was as near as possible on a par with that in Ireland  and in all railway speculations  hun son deemed population to be the first element of success. if he were told that the population of Ireland was incapable of traling from porty and wanton means he would reply that the results on the existing Irish railways ga a flat denial to any such assertion. if enthrone were promise of such profit in railway enterprise in Ireland how was it that private speculators in England did not come forward to inst capital in it 1 he could not answer the question he only knew that the fact was so arising perhaps partly from fashion and partly from want of confidence and that the result was that some of the best speculations in Ireland bad stuck fast from want of money. as then there was this general distrust in the english money market his proposition was that the goment should come to the aid of the railway companies his plan was that for ery  expended on the railway by the companies  should be lent by the goment at the same interest at which it borrowed the money. it might be said that money thus lent would be lent at a less rate of interest than could be got elsewhere and that it would be lent on insufficient security ho then proceeded to refute these objections and to show that the security afforded to the state in this way would be a sufficient security.   the chairman of 1700 miles of railroad was ready to pledge his commercial credit that the state would not lose a single shilling by acceding to this proposition.  hun son had informed him atlatl the worst railroad under his direction was capable of affording cent. per cent. security to the goment  and he had documents to pro which he read to the house that the worst railroads in Belgm and Germany would afford sufficient security for such a loan as he had proposed. he would assume the interest of money to be now  per cent. and if the line were to pay  on er . that would afford ample security  but he undertook to pro that there would not be a single line in Ireland which loud not pay more than that sum. he next undertook to show that the effect of passing the measure which he then proposed would so stimulate the employment of english capital in Ireland that it would forthwith complete all the railroads of that country. to carry that measure into effect he proposed that the railroad commiessinners appointed under the act of last year should be formed into a board responsible to parliament for dealing out those loans. he would throw on that board the responsibility of the full performance of the various duties imposed upon it and wold enact that unless the board certified at once that the railway would be beneficial and was a sufficient security the state should not advance any money to the promoters of it. having explained to the house the situation in which his proposition would place the shareholders ho next exhibited the double effects which it would produce upon labor it would set to work an immense mass of laborers on the railroads and would at the same time enable the shareholders to set free their money for the improment of their own estates and to employ an additional number of men in their cultivation. as an instance of the results likely to arise from his plan he mentioned that such a loan as he had described made to the  Waterford railroad would set at oboe 16000 men to work and that too in four baronies alone which had been paying  a month for unproducti works with a prospect of continuing that payment for some months. he thought it ber that the advances should be made directly to the railroad companies than through the security of the land  for it appeared to him to be impossible to assess on the land any rate which was to be applicable to the future maintenance of railways. such were the  features of his plan  and in producing it to the house he did not bring it forward either in hostility or rivalry to lord j. Rusell though the plan had originated at the house of sir j. Terrell and though the bill had been drawn up er since last Nomber still with the exception of the hon. member for  it had not been communicated  any Irish railway company or to any gentleman connected with Irish property. it might be fid that this measure was more favorable to the proprietors of Ireland than that which they had formerly proposed themsels. it might be so  but the reason for introducing it was not so much to benefit the landed interest of Ireland Pasto stimulate the employment of the  of that country. he showed that such would be the effect of it by reminding the house that plans had been or were before it for completing 1500 miles of railroad in  now to execute those works 60 men would be wanted for each mile for four years. 1500 miles would therefore gi employment to 90000 men for four years on earthworks aud the line of road. it was estimated that the employment to artificers on those roads would occupy six men a mile. that would employ 9000 more. moreor a railway in making new fences in squaring fields and in making drains watercourses and roads would occupy as many men as were engaged in instructing it. thus altogether 109000 persons would be employed independently of the other miscellaneous occupations to which the expenditure of so large a body of men would necessarily gi rise. he therefore estimated that this measure would gi employment to 110000 persons representing with their families 550000 souls. if then by a measure such as this costing the country nothing and leaving it some profit he could feed 550000 souls for four years he thought that he should go a long way in assisting lord Rusell to carry out his act for the amendment of the Irish poor   for independently of its other advantages his arrangement would afford the board of guardians additional means of providing labor for  orisons out of employment. he then informed the house that he had inserted in his bill clauses providing that the contractors should pay their laborers once a week and in hard cash and that if any of them should postpone the payment from Saturday to Monday or longer he should be compelled to pay double wages for ery day during which the payment was postponed. he had also inserted a clause by which the railway companies on the demand of the railroad commies sinners would be compelled to provide suitable huts and lodgings for their laborers before the works of the rail roads commenced. he then proceeded to consider  effects which would be produced upon Ireland generally by the construction of these railways. he calculate the improment of the land one mile on each side of each railway to be sufficient to pay for the construction of the railways themsels estimating that in 25 years it would add  to the landed property of Ireland. he also calculated that these railways when completed besides relieving the county cess from supporting 550000 souls would pay  year to the  for tho purpose of maintaining the agent infirm and impotent. inducements like these would call forth the capital of the country  and he had no doubt that if his bill met the approbation of tho house  week would not elapse without its being poured into Irelandand without 200000 laborers being employed at once on the railroads.  land would ha to bl bought for these railroads. on those already constructed  an acre had been paid to the landlord and  to the occupying tenant for his rights. the effect of his measure in this way would be to place  in tho hands of Irish proprietors for the employment of fresh laborand  in the hands of the occupying tenants for their own purposes. he then came to the bearing of this measure on the renue. he had heard it said that his plan of raising  on the security of  to be applied to railroads would knock down the funds depress the money market and operate as a screw on the trading and manufacturing interests of the country. he  id not think that it would ha any appreciable effect if the necessary sums were raised at intervals of three months as was done in 1835 in tho case of the loan of  for the emancipation of the Negroes  and they must be timid financiers indeed who anticipated any mischief from it. en if he had not the experience of the loan of 1835  direct him he should say that money spent in the country and not out of it and spent too for the advantage of producti and nati industry must be beneficial to the funds and to the trading interest of  empire. whilst he was thus calling ti his country to leu to Ireland  at the rate at which it borrowed it and without any further charge he felt it right to state that the councilor of the exchequer when he advanced koans to public works did not stand in the same position as a private capitalist who looked to nothing but the payment of his principal and interest. he was sure that the right hon. gentleman when he looked back at the great things which the sums spent in the constructionists had done for the renue would agree with him  thinking that the state would be a sleeping partner in this conce. it would rep from the expenditure of 00 on railways in Ireland an enormous increase of renue in the increased consumption of articles of excise and customs. after declaring that it was a scandalous calumny to assert that english loans to Ireland had ner been repaid and after quoting the report of lord Devons commiession to corroborate that declaration he proceeded to eulogize the good faith of the Irish people and to gi seral striking instances of it. he then denied the danger of any outbreak in Ireland and expressed his belief that the peasantry who had purchased firearms had not purchased  for any disloyal purpose. he was then commencing his peroration when he recollected that he had not ured a word respecting the manner in which this loan was to be repaid. it was his intention that the interest of the loan should commence on the day of its being advanced and that the principal should be repaid in 30 years by installments commencing sen years after a certificate was gin of the completion of the railway. he then retued to his panegyric on the character of the Irish people eulogized their patience amid the most direful suffering and concluded by saying that if by his measure he could fill their bellies with good beef and mutton and their cottages with fine wheat and sound beer and. their pockets with english gold to purchase the blankets of Wiltshire the fustian of Manchester and the cotton prints of Stockport he though a Saxon would answer with his head for their loyalty and would lead them through their warm hearts and sympathies not to ser but to cement the union of Ireland with England. the noble lord then concluded a speech which lasted for more than two hours and a half amid loud and long cheers from all sides of the house lord j.  laving paid a well tued compliment to the patriotism of lord g. Bentinck and to his ability both in framing and expounding his plan wished that it had been  that he could ha adopted it in aid of the plans which he had brought forward for the relief of the Irish poor. in point of fact the mar not the plan which lord g. Bentinck had brought forward had been for some time past under the consideration of her majesty goment. some years ago lord  on behalf of the goment had brought forward a plan of railroads which he lord j resell thought and still considered likely to benefit Ireland. lord  contemplated the construction of railways by goment of which the retus were calculated to produce 4 per cent. interest on the money advanced and which were to be applied in case they produced more than 4 per cent. to the reduction of fares and to the extension of branch railways. it was thought that such a plan which would ha gin the goment a control or the railroads ry useful for the forwarding of the mail and other purposes would ha been much superior to that adopted in England where the railroads had grown up almost free from all goment control. but that was not lord g. Bentincks plan. adrting to the details of tat plan he obserd that he did not consider it advisable for goment to step out of its proper sphere to interfere with the general instment of capital and to foster one set of companies at the expense of another. he then stats that when the railway companies of Ireland waited on him with a proposition that goment should add  in three years to the 00000 which they would expend in the same time he had considered it principally in its bearing on the relief of tho then existing distress. the funds at bis disposal were not large but limited. of all wants the most pressing was the want of food in the remoter districts of Ireland. now he found that the application of money to Irish railroads would not ha benefited those districts at all  for in looking to the counties through which the proposed railways were to pass he found that they were the most flourishing in Ireland. railroad labor therefore would not ha applied to  districts which were most distressed and fo which it was necessary that the antion of goment should be first drawn. he did not mean to deny that tb establishment of railroads in Ireland would be of great permanent benefit to it. but having a case of extreme destitution before him he did not think it wise to devote to the promotion of railroads for if goment did  it could beck other expenditure much more necessary and immediate. he did not hower intend to oppose the motion for lea to bring in this bill. in saying so he hoped that he should not hereafter be accused of deception if on a future occasion he should gi it decile opposition. he thought that it would not be wise to adopt this scheme. in a future stage of the bill it uld be necessary to go into a commie of the whole house to repro a grant of public money to carry it into effect on that occion it would be incumbent on the goment either to adopt the scheme as their own or to put a decided negati on it. now he was not prepared for the first alteati and should therefore adopt the lar  b. osboe expressed his admiration of  bold grand and comprehensi plan just propounded to tho house by lord g. Bentinck and his delight at seeing his great and powerful energies applied to the consijetion of the condition of Ireland. he should gi his warmest support to his motion.  roebuck was sorely xed at the course adopted by lord j Rusell in giving his assent to the introduction of this bill which he intended to destroy on a future occasion. ho for one should oppose the introduction of the bill altogether for he objected to the taxation of the industrious people of England for the instment of their capital in any speculation whatsoer. we were now supporting millions of the Irish people at an expense of more than half the money which after paying the interest on the national debt remained for carrying on the goment of this great country  and yet we were to be accused of hardheartedness and to be assailed with many other harsh expressions if they objected on the part of the suffering people of England to gi to the Irish that good beef and mutton and strong beer which their constituents wanted and to fill their pockets with that english gold which they had not themsels  english gold in Irish pockets   that would be at once the commencement and the end of the halcyon state of things which lord g. Bentinck anticipated. having animadrted with some serity on the extraordinary exhibition which he said that lord g Bentinck bad made of himself at the close of his speech he ga notice that if on this occasion the house should depart from hg grand le of allowing private enterprise to regulate private capital he should demand as son as any sum was granted to the suffering poor of Ireland a similar  for the suffering poor of England  for it was quit evident that  were fast coing to a geral scramble for property. the plan of lord g b1tinck was either good in likely nr it was good for the relief of tho existential distress lard j. rt sell had shown its uselessness for the lar object  and as to its first object he would olser that it was taking an unfair advantage of the present distress of Ireland to press the claims of its  on the compassion of the people of England. if er such a bill of appropriation should be brought into parliament he certainly would introduce a clause into it that no Irish landlord being a member of  should ha any  in the spoil. he had the satisfaction of knowing that at a future stage the crown would refine its aent to certain clauses of this bill and that it must in consequence be gin up. but w not crush it at once   at had the house been doing that night for the people of Ireland  absolutely nothing. they had wasted three good hours for no other purpose than tent of giving lord g. Bentinck an opportunity of making a great display and a crack speech. the bill was then brought up read a first time and ordered to be read a second time on Thursday next.,GOVERNMENT AND IRISH RAILWAYS.,4,2/5/1847
leading article Friday  5 1847. so more and more still is demanded demur but there are occasions when for Ireland a loan of  or good nature gets the start of discretion thereabouts to finish her railways is and very soon loses its labor 1110 asked for. certainly when the project is magnitude of the project and its very at put in so specious and pleasant a form as tr activeness enjoin a thorough sifting it was last night it may be ill natured to we are asked to play with great sums to step into immense undertakings to interfere with grave interests to show extraordinary favor to establish unusual precedents to do what we have never done and what we have imide it a most particular point not to do on other not less deserving occasions. as the scheme is pressed with a fervor and popularity which give some faint indication of eventual success it is better to discuss its merits in imine before people have committed themselves too far. in the first place what is the occasion of this demand 1 the Irish public with an impetuosity we did our utmost to check with a slovenliness that characterized every stage of their petitions and with a special indulgence on the part of the legislature which we considered anything but kindness have obtained acts for railways amounting to 1522 miles. both money and credit are wanting. though some of these acts have been passed eleven years only 123 miles of railway have been completed and only 164 are in process of completion at the present moment. the  calls  are not paid up and the lares are at a frightful discount. the native capitalists are no capitalists at all. the landowners are  stuck fast. the directors come to the english market for loans and find somehow the  fashion  against them. they are encountered by a sort of panic or epidemic of want of confidence in everything Irish. so the  fix  is complete. government therefore is to set the fashion restore the confidence lend the money finish the railways change discount into premium fill the pockets of the shareholders and perform all thorn other wonders which harlequin is expected to do on the stage and a minister in the emerald isle. now with all due respect to the fashionable  principle of introducing capital into Ireland we beg to observe that in this part of the empire we usually hold that the facility of obtaining capital is the chief test of utility that it is not ultimately advantageous to force a particular improvement much in advance of the general progress and that a universal want of confidence is commonly too well founded. the moneyed men of this country are not so hoodwinked by fashion or favoritism  they are not so ignorant and suspicious as to throw away the real prospect of a good percentage. if lord George Bentinck will prove by figures that the unfinished Irish railways will pay 7 per cent. he will have no need to go to the house. he need only open shop as an Irish share broker and the millions will flew in. but what is the difference between the proposed railways and the new roads now so universally stigmatized as useless unproductive and demoralizing  a railway is only a better sort of road and it is also more expensive. if a road is a work of the  unproductive. class point which seems agreed on all sides so also is a railway. both are immediately unproductive both are ultimately productive if judiciously designed but otherwise a great waste of money and labor at least let us take warning by the past and not pass in a moment from crying down roads to crying up railways. nor does it follow that because 123 miles of railway in all Ireland pay well that 1522 miles will enjoy an equal success. unfortunately the favor cannot be shown without a flagrant injustice to many we had almost said myriad sin this country who deserve favor quite as well. it is true that as far as we know there are not any railways in England now at a standtill. but the shares of many have fallen to a discount and the shares of all have fallen very far below the price at which  were estimated twelvemonths since and at which they probably came into the and of their present holders. his fall too is owing to the verb same circumstances that have cast down Irish shares viz the perpetual  calls the straitness of the money market and the high price of food the depreciation as compared with intrinsic merits and paying power of the hens has been quite as great here as in Ireland perhaps the noble author of the present scheme is hardly aware  extent of the inconvenience not to say suffering caused by this downfall of prices and the variety of classes affected. every fresh  call  throws down the price of shares and compels a large proportion of the holders to part with them for what they will fetch in the market. the trade of the country is seriously embarrassed by the number of those who are now selling at a loss or holding on with crippled means. the grant of  to the lines of one province would help to depreciate all the rest. now we cannot but think that a very deep and formidable sense of injustice would be generated in the minds of the english shareholders who in the midst of all their own losses and entanglements saw the Irish shareholders suddenly lifted up out of the mire and helped through their difficulties with full pockets by a special favor which at the same time gave the coup de grace to their own hopes of returning premium a sstem of loans which is not equally extended to the whole country is only robbing peter to pay  the chancellor of the exchequer cannot make money or food out of nothing. but what  the favored class done to deserve this favor  or what should put one speculation more under national protection than another   the present relief it would afford to Ireland is an even more questionable afar in certain limited localities in the least distressed parts of the island the railroads would employ some 50000 of the best  those who were so fortunate is to be on tho spot or those who could easily seek work on the scotch and english lines. the employment would not teach agriculture or manners or morals. navigators seldom return to agricultural labor that these 50000 would be better fed for the time would consume more excisable commodities might within the twenty four hours after rec icing their weekly pay have gold in their pocket eat beef and mutton and drink strong beer is certain enough. but the rest of the empire from the richest to the poorest would pay for that dangerous prosperity. the honest and obedient drudges of this island would be removed farther  ever from these unknown unattainable luxuries. the laborers of Dorsetshire and the operatives of Lancashire are already  paying the piper every workingman in this island his an Irish peasant on his back and may deem himself only too fortunate if both are not floundering in tho mud before next august. but if these 50000 able bodied Irish navigators  no particular claim no more have the landlords. give them  per acre for their land give them their shares at a premium what is there to tie the money down to the Irish soil and stay it from going that road marked by footsteps all one way that leads to the den of the devouring absentee  but why is so serious an innovation on the practice of the empire put forth by itself without any more of the

general apat in Ireland lead article Monday march 8 1847. there is one feature of the famine in Ireland which has forcibly impressed itself on the english public and which we animadvert on now for the benefit of those whom it specially concerns. so mockly prominent is it that we ture to say it  ever be recorded as distuish the present from similar calamities. tho astound apat of the Irish themselves to the most horrible scenes immediately under the eyes and capable of relief by the smallest exer is someth absutely without a parallel in the history of civilized nas. all that. we read of in  descrip of Turkish or Chinese fatalism of the indifference to life on tho banks of the Ganges or the brutality of patical tribes sinks to noth tak examples and opportunities into account compared with the absute inertia of the Irish in the midget of the most horrify scenes. the Turkish predestinarian sees a fellow creature struggl for life in tho water and will not  throw hm a roo though it lies at ins feet. he sees a poor wretch assault by 2 assassins in the street and clos s not e take the pipe from his mouth to lend a hand or raise an alarm. we can understand this hock as it is  but we cannot understand what appear to be of daily occurrence in Ireland and what we have on the authority of persons who sorn to share the general stupidity. we are td by eye witnesses of scores and hundreds of poor creatures actually dy for want of a meal  families perish a member a day  an d woman found half starved on Monday dy on Tuesday dead on Wednesday unburied on Saturday half devoured by rats on Monday dragged along the ground by a dy brother or roughly carted to the burial ground and there laid with not e a sufficient cover of soil. we are td of whe families round dead at a time in populous neighborhoods churcards am scraped scarcely deeper than the soil usually is for plant potatoes and tho clinsia coffins there are aid three deep on the surface. but the naivete with which thee horrors are related  persons perfecy competent to pret them is what utterly passes an english apprehension. informants of all kinds priests who pretend to claim the obedience of the flocks laymen able at least to write a letter to a newspaper and make a speech at n meet and clergymen liv in cases and parsonage houses with horses servants and  us theine ths vita as much composure as they would of a murrain in a rookery or the destruc of a cony of rats. a letter in the Irish news today is only one of many we have insetted with Douala astonishment at the contents. a groceryman at smithereens is visited by two genemen from oxford who brim a contribu from the university elicited like similar contribus from many other places by the published accounts of skibob  the money sent to that village in every imaginable way as naal relief money as part of the public subscrip and as more private cl sc ions has been so considerable as to double the popula by entic poco creatures from all parts of the

sights they are  but not to speak of tho money that has been sent to this place the shock incidents related are such as mere manual help with a very lite food could have obviated. we refer our reader to the letter. let them judge for themselves. some days since there was another case e more extraordinary. a clergyman td us oi his driv in a gig with his servant through his parish and be dected to a hut  re a woman had died and had not receive ed christian burial. he looks over the garden wall wd sees the corpse half in tho ground and torn by dogs while a  yards off he recognized as her ha what he had mistaken for the tail of a horse. he throws a stone at the dogs gees home and writes a letter to the newspaper. if our readers will take notice they will find that the great bulk of the letters describ the horrible incidents of the famine betray the same unaccountable obtuseness of feel and ac. people die with money in the pockets because the shop is a few miles off and nobody will fetch them a meal. a. sort of judicial helplessness interferes at ovary  of the misfortune. the whe popula seem jest a day too late fo entry net of relief. the food or the coffin is always bought twenty four hours behind  e time. but that delay is enough to sete the business. w what are these people all made of 7  ski b  like one of those cities mened in oriental history where the men were all maimed

Ireland is cursed wit 010111  but at the same time there lies grant room for fallacy and deception under general assertio of poverty. there are ny rates and condo of poverty. in chat see is Ireland

exportation  poor as Ireland is all these questio must be a1 in the negative. what was lord George Bentinck receipt for the amino as s on ts it appeared in good earnest  could no longer be called a Tamworth lie  he discovered that Ireland annually exported enough of corn alone to supply the whole deficiency of the potato crop.  let it keep those three millio of quarters at homo and they will feed rit short commo and wit a little else to help five millio of people. this was his advice to the best of our recollection and very fair advice as regarded the end though the w and mea were not very clear. we cherish the memory of that suggest on impracticable almost to the verge of mockery as it  it recognized a great principle the lien hit poverty has on the produce of the land.  to the inconience of thee who had been accustomed to depend on that supply and had nude all their arrangements accordingly lord George was for putting an embargo on the corn at the Irish ports and sending it back to the famished children of tho soil.  suggestion also gives a fortunate prominence to the fact that there is that quantity of corn the food of three millio annually sent  of the island. nor is that all. the other exports of food of  bur cheese lard eggs  other nutrit.io commodes are on the same  scale.  poor  exports  re cod than any other cpuntry in the whole world not merely more in

defect. stand on the qus of Ireland and see the ffreighted vessels leaving her noble rivers and coves. you will there see that so far from Ireland being urly radically and incurably poor barren and unprofitable she is one of the great feeders of this populous   n its chief purveyor. it is true that several portio of this island might be taken which out of a very much less area cribute to the wants of the adjacent districts e a greater ampunt of rterce. but that is hary a fair  Ireland does this out of her poverty besides feeding after a manner an immee population. it is this that adds so painful an interest to her miserable state that she should  make many rich and yet remain herself 110 poor and be the author of an abundance which sloe is not permid herself to enjoy. it is very clear then that the  f Ireland is not irremediable. lord  Bentinck has gi us some clue to a remedy. this drain of food must be first stanched bent in order to that it is necessary to ask who it is that sucks aud exhaust tho life blood of the island i who  the exactor of this fab tribute 7 does it go to p dent or rent or tax or the price of equivalent imports they who  pleased to represent Ireland as the victim of an imperial oppression will be apt to imagine that the state the  is the master drain. on the crary tho state draws nothing from Ireland. as far as regards her public expenditure Ireland  all the advantages aud more than the advantages of an independent kingdom. great Britain not only draws nothing from the Irish treasury but gives Ireland the gratuitous benefit of her on enormous reue both in respect of  colonial empire besides other common advantages and also in exteive gents and advances for the pecur relief and improvement of Ireland. the whole of the Irish reue including every sixpence obtained for customs excise stamps and postage from tea sugar coffee tobacco spirits and from every other article imported or manufactured in tho island is spent in Ireland itself. not one  is remid to tho brsh exchequer. that taxation cannot be called heavy or oppressive which is levied almost exclusively on luxuries and not in all cases   e on them as in the rest of the empire  wh Ireland is exceed wit what we think an illjud kindness from many english taxes. this light taxation is all refunded on frosh soil. wo repeat for the information of pero who probably never saw or  of the figures of the question that Ireland ps not one sixpence to the brshthat is the imperial excheuer. in tho year ending January 5 1845 the total expenditure out of the reveal of Ireland was   this  was for pments out of  income in its progress to the exchequer for charges of collection and other pments   was for the dividend interest and management of the public funded debt pable in Ireland  for other permanent pments out of the coolidated fund   for the army in Ireland   for the ordnance   for miscellaneous pments  and in the place of the gradually diminishing sum which in prevs years had been applied to the reduction of the cognitional debt and remittances to the brsh exchequer the return for that year was nil. in point of fact the current had already set in from the brsh to the Irish treasury. the  advances  are not reckoned in this statement and the balance due on them to the coolidated fund at January 5 1845 already ampunted to  sing that  it is unnecessary to  that Ireland has cributed to the brsh treasury nothing but an enormous loss  nor is there the least likelihood of any other kind of cribution for many a year to come. Ireland hm is at the  time rich and poor. it produces a vast superabundance of food but that food is drained frosh its shores. it is not however drained by the state. it is drained in a great measure by the lanorls and their creditors who tb more they can get the more they will drain. now what does mercy to Ireland require under these circumstances  is it mercy to let the lanord go on drain drain drain for ever 1 is it mercy to let him go on squeezing the hapless peasant down to the kin of his potato  is it of any um has it been of any use to remit rates and taxes and lend money to the lanorls  no. the only mercy is to keep  island and upon the spot the gracs gifts of providence and rewards of man toil and to compel the landowner to spend them in the employment of the laborer and ts relief of the poor.,PLEAS AGAINST A POOR LAW,2,3/12/1847
the poor relief bill. debate in parliament Saturday march 13 1847. in the hones of commons on the state the recent proceedings of the government with respect to the escalations that the speaker do now leave vomitous state of affairs in Ireland and tithe chair for the commie on the poor call antion to one or two of the pro relies  visions of the bill then before the house lord j. Rull declared his wish to in the present condition of public affairs when clouds and darkness rested on Ireland and when many perils were before the house it was only right that he should make the house acquainted with the steps which government had taken from time to time to relieve distresss and also with the measures which if carried must exercise a serious influence on the destiny of not merely Ireland but of England also. having entered at considerable length i the reasons which had induced the government to adopt some propositions and to reject others and having given the house a history of the operation of the various legislative measures which had been pad with the view of providing food and employment for the people of Ireland returned to the consideration of the poor law bill on which it was necessary for him to address the house at some length in consequence of a representation that had recently been made to him by 64 peers and 23 members of that house well acquainted and bang conversant with the condition of Ireland. ha could not consent to the reasons which th had urged upon him with a view of inducing him to give up thee provisions of the bill which afforded outdoor relief to the able bodied laborer when in destitution  and above all he differed from their artion that the experience of the last 12 months was conclusive against the plan of poor law relief which he was now proposing. he pointed out the difference between the relief now afforded nonpublic works in Ireland mid the relief to be given hereafter m and out of the Irish workhouses and showed that there was nothing in the bill which made the relief to be given to the able bodied laborer of Ireland gratuitous relief. in England when the workhouse was full and relief was given out of the workhouse labor was given as a test of destitution and he proposed that a similar plan should be adopted in Ireland. admitting however to these noblemen and genmen that it might be very difficult to prevent out door relief from being ai accompanied with abuses he asked them since th objected so strongly to his proposition whether th had any plan to propose as a substitute for it and if th had to explain it to him in detail. he repeated to them in public the question which he bad asked in private and hoped that he should be more successful now than he had been then in obtaining an answer. he admid  there was much of charity in Ireland  but it was not the charity of the rich to the poor but the charity of the poor to the very poor. until the passing of the poor law act which he bad first introduced i Ireland and which ln now asked leave to extend he did not think that there was any burden imposed on either the resident or absentee landlord of Ireland except the optional burden arising from the calls of private charity and that iwis easily avoided. considering then that the destitute in Ireland who were not in the workhouses had hitherto been supported by the voluntary charity of the middle and still more by that of the lower class he saw no other mode of supporting them in future when the condition of Firdausi would be entirely changed in consequence of the diminished cultivation of the potato by  small owners than by adopting the bill which he now recommended to the house. in making that announcement he thought that he could support it on gros perfectly plain and intelligible. what he now proposed as a permanent poor law for Ireland had been fo in England to be perfectly consistent with  wealth security and pro  of the coubtry. let no one talk to him of tb abuse of the poor law  for we bad reformed them in England  and yet in the last ten years we had spent  in support of the poor. he contended that it was good economy to lay out such a sum for such a purpose he showed tb mode in which the english poor law had met the destitution d tln year 1840 when there was a greater want than ordinary of food and employment for the poor of England  and he now proposed that in Ireland in future when there was a deficient instead of an average harvest the same mode and nature of relief should be applied to that coubtry. he admid that the present calamity of Ireland was so overwhelming that no poor law would have bran  fully to meet its emergency. most unfortunately for Ireland by tho connivance of landlords tenants and laborers there had grown up on its soil a miserable cottier population and an immense army of mendicants whose numbers and condition had been frequently portrayed to the house. such being the case he did not imagine that such a calamity as the present cold have been met by the gt btry and farms of Ireland. though many of the resident gebtry had nobly performed thar duty he must say speaking of them as a body that tho exertions of property in Ireland at the present c  had not  so great as th ought to have been. he thought that among  resident landlords  were many who  go further tan h  had yet gone in contribution  relief of distress  in abstinence from luxury and that was an  reason why he should not leave the destitute poor of that coubtry any longer to the mere hazard of being revved he had Bern told that in som parts of Ireland the population was so gnat and the property o inadequate to its  that property must inevitably break down er the operation of this bill. he dd not believe the artion. he admid that his provision for the pour might take a large proportion of the rental now obtained  but that certainly was not the case at present. in langlauf the average rate levied for the relief of the poor amounted to ls.  in the po upon the rental  but in Ireland it did not exceed   did not  this as a reproach to the proprietors of Irelandfor th had done all that was required of them by law but as a proof that there was property in Ireland on which government could call for a larger assment than that paid at present to the relief of the poor.  one lnd been shocked by the number of deaths which had occurred in the union of  and by the miserable condition of its surviving inhabitants. now the property of that union was estimated to the rates at  year but its real annual value was not  than  year. the poor rate there was  in the po. it had been raised it was true in November last to   but that rate had never been levied he mentioned this circumstance as a proof that there had not been in Ireland that proper assment and levy of the rates for the relief of tho poor which circumstances required  and that was another justification for this bill. he believed that it would induce the landlords and farmers of Ireland to give more employment than at present  for when th fo that the laborer must be supported either while ho was doing work useful to themselves or while he was doing work of no use to them at all th would prefer to support him in the first state rather than in the lar. he then proceeded to defend that clause of the bill by which it is provided that one half of the board of guardians should be formed of magistrates  ex officiousus guardians. he consider d that the dissatisfaction which that mdse had excited in Ireland must have arisen from the belief that the magistrate that coubtry were hostile to the religious feelings and prejudices of the great bulk of the population. now if the magistrates were always to be considered by the farmers and  of Ireland as their enemies he should be afraid of placing in the board of guardians an equal body of farmers and magistrates but we were on the eve of great changes in Ireland  and he believed that we were now in a course of transition to those times when all the Irish would act willingly together for the benefit of their common coubtry and would credit his artion that in England there was no wish to debar them from any privilege or object of ambition which was naturally their due. he hoped that in these boards of guardians we should  protestants and roman Catholics calories Whigs radicals and repealer differing as th did in religious faith and political opinions blending nevertheless in social harmony and acting together in administering justice in conducting pubic works in superintending agricultural improvements and in relieving the destitute as became the inhabitants of the same coubtry. it was with this view and not with any intention of giving any supremacy to the  officiousus magistrates that ho had introduced this clause i the bill in reply to the statement that there were leading Irish proprietors in the cabinet who might influence its decisions on this subject favorably to tho rights of property and unfavorably to those of the poor he remarked that those members of the cabinet were parties with him in the proposition of this measure. if it imposed burdens on the land of Ireland the were willing to bear their share of it and it was with their sanction that he moved that the house do now resolve itself i commie on tho poor relief Irelandbill,THE POOR RELIEF

leading article Saturday march 13 1847. lord john Russell does not at all overstate the difficulty of his path when he says that clouds and darkness rest over Ireland and legislation is beset with perils. often and often as statesmen may have thought that they  come to the bottom  of Irish distress no one can deny that a worse than all has arrived and moreover that a worse still remains. the f of the populous island usually verging on famine now actually suffers that dreadful extremity  nor is there any appearance of early relief. the usual food of the people has perished and threatens not to return for a period far beyond the calculations of man. the only storehouse to which the public purveyor can look for relief is that natural magazine created by the industry of the people over and above their own simple wants and usually reserved for the payment of rent and other outgoings  and the supplies providently arriving from distant shores. the former of these is that which common sense and economy would teach us most to depend upon. but here is the difficulty. to arrest that nourishing and fertilizing stream in its course to detain it on the spot to convert it into the relief of distress the wages of labor and the material of reproduction is at least an apparent and possible loss to those who have hitherto exacted wasted or alienated this store. hence a serious struggle between the rights of the many and the rights of the few between starving peasants and straitened proprietors between famine and pestilence on the one hand and decay of fortune and position on the other. such are the perilous alternatives before the house  such the clouds and darkness over Irish affairs. . for our own part we do not hesitate to avow as we have ever avowed on  occasions that at such a crisis the few must give way to the many the part to the whole. while we most thoroughly pd at the same time most gladly believe hat the proprietors exaggerate the sacrifices demanded at their hands we assert with all boldness that and was created for man and not man for land  that landlords are made for the people and their peculiar interests are only ministerial and subordinate to the good of the whole. a general in the field must fay hold of the stores that he finds and devote them in the first inherence to that purpose which he is bound to consider a paramount object the maintenance of his army. the compensation he may think proper to afford to  owners is another an a secondary question. vv hat is lord john  but our commandeer in an unexampled campaign Ireland the field famine the foe and the army a vast population without magazines order material or in a word any other resource than tho boldness and skill of their chief l the necessity of tb crisis admits not the usages or rather the abuses of peace. if  evil custom has deprived the laborer of his hire this is just the time to found a more equitable system. labor and wages population and wealth have suffered a long divorce and must now be reconciled. grant that the change is great and what a man would not willingly underte  it is forced on the legislature. society is reconstructed in disaster  each new birth is in throes and institutions are the monuments of wrong. in  clouds and darkness  it is necessary to  a short and simple rule the guidance cf some great moral truth. the first law of nature that tho people must be fed and that more particularly from the work of their hands is the clue of this labyrinth. in the public weal an enlightened statesman will discern the cloud by day and the  of fire by night through this terrible wilderness  and public weal is an  name unless it includes the relief of those who are ready to perish and the employment of those who are able to work but have not the opportunity. he minister tes an unassailable position when he rests the new Irish relief bill on the new facts of the case he is entid to call it the child of necessity. it is contrary to the theories of his jess experienced age and less fearful times. Ireland has undergone a virtual revolution. the food of independent poverty has failed. the spontaneous charity of the lower classes has been.exhsted. the armies of mendicancy have been destroyed or disbanded. all that miserable system which was rather an apology for society than a civilized society itself has fallen to the ground. politicians held it up as long as they could. secretaries of state found it convenient and eulogized the noble and trustworthy custom of a perpetual inbreeding beggary. the right of preying on the infant resources of rising enterprise and blighting the first bloom of prosperity was cried ill as a sacred and infallible which it would have bee impious to supplant with the coarse expedient of a  all that is passed. providence not man has put an end to atlatl folly. he cottier remains without a crop  the beggar without a dole. a physical revolution has overthrown the reign of mendicancy and co nacre there is no possible no conceivable alternative but to create another system on the ruins or rather in the place of the old. time is the greatest innovate and we only submit to his laws when we erect a new system on a new foundation that is the present facts of the case. without a real poor law offering relief to the destitute and employment to the idle how are we to meet the new phenomenon of a people in the midst of comparative abundance but deprived of their wonted food  paying rent but without a maintenance  depending on a root that will not thrive or on neighbors that cannot give 1 a  crisis justifies and demands  a great. experiment. the dictates of nature are interpreted by the voice of tb people  and from all sides are returned  innumerable echoes to the ministerial decision.,"(LEADING ARTICLE, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1847.)",2,3/13/1847

by it. it is all the other way. whater hypothetical griance or honorary distinction Ireland may claim as jointly interested in the imperl debt she has suffered no practical wrong whater by it  for she has little beyond her debts to contribute. she was always in this predicament  she must either discharge the current expenses of the year and forego to pay the interest of her debt or else pay the interest of her debt and throw the burden of her expenses on the imperl treasury. as the amount of the former has generally been about equal to her renue she has been in dented to England for defraying the latter. the following synopsis represents the relation borne by her income to the annual charge of her debt and the cost of her government from 1817 to 1820 and again from 1840 to 1846

calls saddling Ireland with the debts of England  England pays the  odd which is annually raised from Ireland to the Irish upholder and then out of her own pocket defrays the charges of horse foot

administration of a poor law. letter to. e editor Wednesday April 7 1847. sir your paper has taken a distinguished position as e advocate of an effective poor law for Ireland feeling in common wi you at a measure of is nature can alone lay a foundation for any improvement in e cition of e people of at portion of e united kingdom i am anxious at when a triumphant majority of e house of commons has forced is measure rough its previous stages its uses and operation should not be destroyed by e indirect but more dangerous assaults of its opponents. i am erefore. desirous to be permitted to refer to some pouts which i ink may not be sufficieny understood by e British public.  e preent tactic of e opposing section of Irish landlords  eir english supporters is to defeat e action of e measure by e non coction of rates. is would be e certain effect of e clause moved by lord George Bentinck on May night. i am inclined to hope at e no lord did not understand e result which his own motion would produce  and at he was made e instrument of oers to defeat in is way e measure which he had helf voted for. is proposition was only defeated by a majority of ree and as it is confideny expected by e Irish  at i will be successful in e lords ink it is a matter of importance at its object and operation should. 119 clearly slated e purport of e clause proposed by lord George Bentinck was to repeal  at power given to e tenant by   poor law act of deducting from e landlords rent a certain proportion of e rate paid by e tenant in e first instance which proportion amounted when e valuation and rent were equal to one half of e whole rate or to a larger proportion when e rent exceeded e valuation e scale operating in such manner at as e rent became higher an e valuation e landlord paid a greater proportion till in e event of e rent being dou e valuation e tenant became entied to deduct e whole rate from bis rent  and in all cases wherein e rent was less an e valuation e tenant in like manner was entied to deduct a proportionals an e half corresping wi e degree in which e rent was lower an e valuation. e intention of e legslature in is enactment was to  pose a pe malty on rack renting and a tax upon absenteeism and to force from e rich an aid in e support of e poor. lord George Bentincks clause would alish tbs most equita division of e rate between e landlord and e tenant and row e whole burden of e rate nigglingly on e tenant except wi regard to e rates of  e landlord would be direcy responsi. is proposition was most artfully supported by e Irish landlord section on e plea of an assimilation of e law of Ireland to at of England and i fear much at many english members were deluded by is specious argume it is true at such has been e english aw for perhaps 300 years  o rights of property and e relations of landlord and tenant have gradually been framed into a conformity wi is law and erefore it would not now be expedient to disturb it but in creating a new law for Ireland i ask is it not fitting and necessary to take into consideration e different stem of landlordism in Ireland and in England 1 e english tenant is in a cition to make a bargain wi a landlord and to address him us you offer me is farm wi e buildings and improvements at suppose  an acre but i find it will be lia to  rates  i cannot have f dr profits and give you more an  an acre. oer competitors looking to a fair return for capital offer no higher re e landlord is us comped to reduce his land to e marketa value founded on a fair calculation of e tenants returns and us virtually pays tie whole rates alough e occupier is direcy lia. but can e Irish tenant assume is independent position 1 no such ing. e poor Irish tenant must have land or starve he can get no wages  lar wherewi to buy foodie cannot have food. except what he raise by lii lar on land in his occupation oers are in e same position an unnatural competition is produced excited by e most powerful of  stimulants e dread of e want of food wiout any relation to e value of e land or e charges affect it. e multiplicity of claimants gives e  full power of extortion rent is fixed by what is cad letting by cant speak of e rack rented portions of  power of extortion is unlimited every burden is cast on e tenant until he is reduced to e necessity of a misera existence on e lowest description even of. potato food. e Irish tenant is not a free agent and erefore has a just claim on e legslature for at protection which e enactment in e original poor law act was intended to afford nim. is was submitted to by e landlords so long as e Irish poor law existed in e state of an imbecile delusion on e people  but now when it is aut to assume e form of a substantial remedy to preserve e pour from starvation and to create a rial responsibility on property is wholesome and  provision is decapod a nuance to be allowed no longer to remain on e statute hook e proposition of lord George Bentinck was but feebly resisted by sir George Grey on e part of e government  he opposed e clause as inexpedie at e preen time  but he was anxious to say noing which could prejudice e consideration of e no lords proposition at a future period   and at future period will arrive as i very much fear when e bill is returned from e lords wi e clause inserted and en e resistance of e government 1 if i can guess at futurity will cease. us e poor occupying tenants in e rack renting districts of Ireland already ground to e ear by landlord oppression and misrule and betrayed by landlord selfishness will have a new infliction added to eir preent intolera burdens.  absentee landlords will clap eir hands wi delight at eir escape from e duties of property and e resident rack renters may continue to shut eir demesne gates upon  poor man as ey hive heretofore clone and sci  us far you may  but no farer. he poor shall continue to support e poor we are saved from confiscation of property. vain imagination  e oppression of e poor tenant will produce a more deadly confiscation by its natural resluts  rents will not b paid and every fresh extortion will add to e evil  en real confiscation will come from e absolute poverty of e people pauperism will increase and e pauperism of e people will create pauperism of e landlordsa just retribution of neglected duties. it is clear at e Irish poor law bill will be a nonentity if rates cannot be cocted. now i shall proceed to show how at effect will be produced if lord George Bentincks clause be carried. you are told rates are now imperfect cocted. is must proceed eier from e poverty of e people or eir unwillingness to pay e rates believe chiefly from e latter cause and why so y because e law as hierto constituted was ineffective for relief. ey see eir fellow creatures starving and no means of feeding emas e act excludes internal relief e houses fid wi poor and cor erupted by disease e entrance into such houses tote mere prelude to deawhy should ey not be unwilling to pay e rates for an administration of relief so cruelly stinted y now e law may be improved but if lord George Bentincks clause be  it will contain new principles of injustice namely e exemption of landlord responsibility accompanied wi an increase of ex officeous guardians placing e administration of e law in e hands of is favored class who have proved emselves its releness opponents. disgust and mistrust will take possession of e peoples minds ey will refuse e payments  e passive resistance principle formerly  effectual in e case of ties will be adopted distresses  be made but no purchasers will be found for e goods  e sale will us become an empty name because e rate will be a rank injustice. i firmly believe a just liberal and humane poor law would meet e sanction of e people and at e rates would be paid to e uttermost farin of eir capabilities  but  law poisoned wi is provision if so passed will create an unconquera spirit of resistance. gain vi regard to at portion of e rate which is now imposed direcy on e landlords for tenements under  value and which it is proposed to increase to  value we have information at e payment is now refused or evaded  at e landlords avail emselves of technical objections  at eir rates are more difficult of coction an e tenants rates  and at ey have even now wi eir preent limited number of ex office guardians sufficient influence in e ards to prevent e proper steps being taken to put e law in force. it is very material is point should be understood. e act of e 7 victoria c. 92 provides at if e rate chargea direcy on e landlord be not paid wiin four mons it shall be lawful for e ard to levy e same after a mons notice given by distress on e occupiers goods.  lite maneuvering will easily effect is retardation. e ards crammed wi ex officeousswill let of e landlords and distrain e occupier and e return will be no goods and no rates. but it will be said e law allows e occupier of ese low valued tenements when distrain d for landlords rats to deduct e payment from e rents. i would ask. what chance would a poor occupier of is description have in a contention to recover rates from an Irish middle landlord or an Irish rack renting proprietor or e rack renting agent of an Irish absentee  he would not dare to name e rate to ese owners or receivers of rentse power to do so is a mere farce an entire delusion. i ink i have now proved at under a law defiled wi such a provision as at submitted by lord George Bentinck no rates would be levied  but is is e very object which e opposing section of Irish landlords desire to effect. ey have prophesier no rates would be obtained  ey are now laring to verify eir own predictions. e Irish people will be again starving and e responsibility will be again rown on e government and e relief of Irish misery will be again a drain upon e resources supplied by British industry. i forewarn e repreentatives of England at if ey desire a poor law for Ireland which shall have any substantial use or action ey must accompany it wi a measure which shall secure e liability of e landlord for e just proportion of e rates as heretofore  and is liability cannot be effective unless e landlord and tenant be made separately lia  for his respective pro. portion so long as you continue to levy e landlords rates rough e means of distress on e tenants goods e tenant will be oppressed e  will be resisted and e levy will be impractica  and no oer means can be adopted for e effectual levy of e landlords rates except by taking a pow to place a receiver on e estates where rates are unpaid  is will be effectual as evidenced in e case of e titi rent charge. unless e Irish poor law act be accompanied wi a measure for e just distribution aud effective levy d e rates in e manner i have suggested i emphatically assert it will be of no more value an e waste paper on which it is printed. such a measure i have introduced in e house of commons and it  lies  r e disposal of  legs nature

proposal for Irish colonization in Canada leading article Wednesday April 7 1847. we have already directed attention to the means by which it has ben proposed to mitigate the distress of Ireland perhaps 110 stronger testimony to the severity of that distress could newfod than the scheme which certain noblemen and genemen of that cotry submitted to the notice of lord  Russell the transportation of some thousands of pauper cottiers for the purpose of foding a pauper colony in America is just such a measure as ought only to be suggested when every other device had either failed or become hopeless. and till eyer other plan has been tried it will be an accotable  we should say a great crimson the part of any ministry to people the forests of Canada with an immigration isolated by religion language and social habits from the mass of the colonists by which it is to be surroded and the government on which it is to depend. even had the ordinary purposes of colonization been kept in mind and its ordinary. preparations made it would have been a dangerous experiment to sete a large Celtic sept der its natural and hereditary chiefs in a remote dependency of the crown. jealousies and heartburnings intentional but avoidable causes of separation manifold and insuperable would evince der such circumstances have occurred to show the foll of giving at tho  time the force of combination and the greater force of isolation to a multitude whose allegiance must always be lukewarm and whose sympathies must  weakened by distance. but when  e scheme professedly rejects an ordinary element of all modes of colonizations instead of planting a commity comprehending all ranks of society and bearing the decided stamp of social order it is intended to transplant only one class and that the weakest the most  and the least educated of all suspicious are naturally aroused at the daring imprudence of the speculation and its detected insufficiency as a makeshift. . . whilst wo admit the justice of the proposition emdied in the memorial that any plan of emigration to be satisfactorily carried out must emanate from private enterprise we are convinced by attending to the incidents of every day that the time has not yet come in which private capital and private energy are to do all for these objects which they are hereafter destined  the subject has been gradually looming on the minds of statesmen  it has beg to assume a somewhat more definite and intelligible shape than that which it once bad. men are reconciling themselves not only to the immediate necessity but the eventual duties of colonization. it is no longer regarded simply. as the shortest means for getting rid of so much wretched poverty and liberating people at home from its fortate supplications  it is now viewed as it ought to be in reference to the fate of the political societies of which it lays the fodation  influence upon the civilized world but while the theory of colonization vas thus become more distinct and potential in the eyes of thinking men the capital which it is necessary to invest in prosecuting its objects has been absorbed into other channels. the last few year sand more particularly the last year have seen the fruits of the national industry locker up in the exacting but not  grateful coffers of one gigantic enter pries for years to come the speculations and the resources of commerce will be confined within one channel. they will in vain endeavor to escape. but as soon as their liberation has been effected and they have been diverted into new courses we shall perhaps see the exhausted wealth and industry of England cooperating to discover new sources of wealth and new springs of industry by schemes of colonization worthy of be incr called national comprehensive and statesmanlike. w hen this time spall have arrived people will look back with wonder to the epoch in which it was gravely proposed to create in Canada a sectarian province of Irish roman Catholics and will ask what means had been exhausted for pro.  at home for the people whom it was thus intended to expatriate the wonder and the curiosity will be equally just. it will then appear that after three centuries . of social. disorganization an effort had been at last earnesy made to put the different classes on their proper footing to lay its equitable burdens on  and give t poverty its just  we hope that  will not in addition have to be related that all the scope of the proposed law was lost and e intentions of its authors defeated by the trickery of an insidious amendment and tat der the pretense of assimilating the english and Irish poor laws the Irish landlords succeeded in introducing a clause which at once disgusted the mass of the ratepayers and made the collection of the rates impossible. yet such would have been the result had lord g . Bentinck amendment in committee been carried. the tenant ratepayer of Ireland would have rne the whole burden of the rate from which his landlord would have been exempted disgust iversal would have immediately been aroused  but the eventual consequence would have been as  s. Crawford dolls us in a letter to which we refer our readers that not a single rate could have been collected. distresses would have been availing for all the force of the law would have been met by the stubrn inertia of passive resistance. that this dangerous coup de tat may yet be attempted in the house of lords is far from improbable  nor is its success there an impossible contingency. but if the amendment be carried there it will be one of the most .fortate pieces of legislation to which their lordships ever put their hands. for from the moment it is enacted confiscation actual sweepings confiscation not that metaphorical one of which we read in reviews and speeches but confiscation arising from penury relieved and laur  will become a substantial danger. as  Crawford writes the  people  be starving the responsibility will again be thrown on government  and the relief of Irish misery will be again a drain on the resources supplied by British industry. but let not landlords great or small lay the flattering ction to their souls that in this extremity they will pacify english justice or ward off their own nemesis by expatriating  pauperism to the banks of the st. law ranee.,PROPOSAL FOR IRISH COLONISATION IN CANADA,2,4/7/1847
the roman catholic clergy in Ireland leading article Thursday April 8 1847. fo have frequently ventured to remind the roman catholic clergy of Ireland that assuming as they do to be the leaders of the people and being to a great extent actually in that position they are bound to do all they can to reform the habits and enlighten the . understandings of their flocks. they are not indeed backward to advise on the contrary they are only too ready touche  temporal purposes he awful prestige of spiritual authority. they do not hesitate to express themselves warmly on the questions of the day nor do  seem to he fettered by a nervous timidity as to the casual effects of their language. we may.  reasonably expect them to give the. adv foe most required by the character and condition of the people and most suited to the crisis . in England we certainly expect this from the lips of our clergy moreover there is a certain wholeness and oneness about the very idea of  any partial . fulfillment whoever  be that teaches a people cannot withy a palpable dis honesty and absurdity pick and  from the virtues cut and carve the com g 2 commandments inculcate this and let alone that by the rule of convenience or other such motive. now in this country there is one virtue which the clergy do not omit to urge on their flocks. the duty of honest industry is early impressed on the child and driven home with continual blows on the man. to do bis duty in that state of life to which providence has been pleased to call him is almost the most definite and peremptory idea of obligation in an english mans mind. the whole nation feels one common impulse to work. all classes high and low rich and poor know they have a. task to be done. everybody  miserable till he finds out his office. an idle man in this island feels himself out of place. he wanders about like an evil spirit seeking rest and seeking it in vain. work work is the order of the day wherever you go. dukes millionaires meh of science clergymen old ladies young ladies all are unhappy because they are solitary and contemptible unless they are doing something and known to be doing it. to be doing nothing is worse than the oriental opprobrium of barrenness.  what doss such an one do with himself 7 is the most insulting question an enemy can ask. on numerous classes the pressure is absolutely overwhelming. they are not allowed a holiday. Joan gremlins twice ten years of  a single day of leisure is by no means uncommon. our laborers give every day of their lives to the service of their country without the subtraction of one hour excepting only Sunday and two or three holidays in the year. how they find time to say a word to their friend show they digest their meal show get five quiet minutes with their children how they say their prayers at least between lady day and Michaelmas is a wonder to all but those in the secret. toil hunts them down. the laws compel  the farmer commands it the clergyman enjoins it the family requires it the country expects it  leaves no alternative every motive conspires. so the laborer and like him all other working men lawyers medical mim merchants shopkeepers included work and think and think and work till their brains are dried to dust their sinews to whipcord and their souls to parchment. wishing most heartily as we do that the english might be spared some of this slavery we have no wish to impose it on Ireland  all work and no play makes jook a dull boy. we sud be sorry to spoil that natural vivacity and wit which throw such a charm over the eccentricities follies and infirmities of the Irish character. at the same time we must. say that England has a right to expect something more than three or four months work in the year from all the subjects of this realm  and she has a. right to expect that the advisers who have occupied the ear of Ireland should back up so reasonable a demand. it is not fit that England should always suffer a monopoly of working and paying. relief for Ireland  rest for England. miserable and degraded as the case of the former country is the peasant still has a. compensation. he enjoys for weeks and months the luxury of idleness. he has  time to tell stories to hand down traditions to practice his wit to talk about politics to play with sedition to attend fairs races monster meetings midnight trainings adventures and councils. if he is now to be maintained by British money in the enjoyment of three luxuries it is evident that the english peasant pays for all this. now we say that while the Irishman has a claim to the english mans money that is to the produce of his labor the Englishman has a claim in his turn to a little of the Irishmans rest. would that the english were a little less occupied the Irish a little more our readers have ah of them read many pastoral addresses and public resolutions of Irish roman catholic clergy. we ask them do they remember that in any one there occurs such a thing vigorous and pointed admonition to regular industry 1 do they remember any expostulation with that which is notoriously the crying evil of Irelandits universal sloth 7 have they ever observed one single text to this effect out of the many hundreds in holy writ quoted by sacerdotal pen 1 does dr male in addressing the least thrifty and industrious people in Europe cite the words of the  wise man or the sound common sense of the apostolic epistles in favor of diligence economy prudence or other such vulgar but respectable virtues 1 on the contrary every word uttered by these clerical authorities appears to have no other design than to unnerve the people to teach them not to depend on themselves and wait for something or other from England from lord horn Russell from  laborer from the landlords from repeal from confiscation or from any other quarter event person or thing after that hideous wretchedness which discolors and deforms the very landscape of Ireland the very first thing that strikes a stranger of ordinary intelligence fresh from the industrious sphere of England is the extraordinary apathy of tho people amidst abet wretchedness and the comparative ease with which that wretchedness might by the slightest exertion and enterprise be converted into comfort and plenty. an instance to use a common phrase will speak volumes on this point. it is known that the rivers and seas of Ireland abound in excellent fish and that this year the shoals are more numerous than ordinary but as usual are generally  to pursue their course unmolested. perhaps the extent of this neglect is not realized. the other day a gentleman of cork the manager of some mines at the ill fated and ill famed village of scull which is about 10 miles from  on the coast borrowed a common rod and line from a Cornish miner in his employ and caught 57 mackerel from the jetty in scull bay before breakfast. each of these mackerel was worth  in cork market 30 miles off yet not a man was attempting to catch them or doing anything but wait upon providence and expect english meal and money. now here is a case for the clergy at once. an apostle would not hesitate to rebuke such neglect of the provision which providence has brought as it were to the very hands and mouths of the mot famished district of the island. he would bid his followers to let down their nets for a  faithful expectation of those miracles which industry and prudence will always achieve. but like people like priest. populous cult  and an obsequious hierarchy dependent not on the prosperity but on the passion of the people withholds those homely but disagreeable lessons which alone can save Ireland ltur they say in their hearts and leave Ireland to its fatalism to listlessness dependence and inevitable ruin. the famine

leading article Wednesday April 14 1847. it might naturally be supposed that the philosop which teaches by example would imprint its lessons more deeply on the human heart than that which preaches abstractedly and that genuine instances of suffering would warn mankind more efficaciously than all the grave saws of morals or of politics. unfortunately this is not so  at least it is not so in Ireland there tho history of the past speaks without effect and the sufferings of the past are recorded without admonition.  amine in one century signalizes its havoc by causes and consequences which are forgotten and repeated in the next. the most desolating pestilence sweeps away its thousand sand is scarcely remembered after it has ceased to slay. the circumstances which either provoked it or aggravated its intensity are swamped by the unaccountable carelessness of the many and the unpardonable indifference of the few.  diet clothing comfort the things which affect all these ss the tenure of land provision for tho poor rents subdivision of estates early marriages unemployed multitudes c. all of which must have been recognized as contributing to the magnitude of one great calamity are all overlooked as soon as its immediate pressure has subsided. in the years 1740 and 1741 Ireland was visited with a severe amine and a destructive pestilence. their records as originally presented in the journals of that day have been recently reprinted for private distribution. the perusal of this documen is painfully curious. it would apply with hardly an alteration to the famine of the present year. except that the poplatino has increased from two to eight millions there is hardly a fact which is not as true in 1847 as it was in 1741.. instead of the aphis  the destroying power was a premature frost. but the food that suffered m both years was the same the precarious and insufficient potato. the consequences were the same  the horrors witnessed the same  the sentimens or prejudices the same  the deeds of admirable kindness or execrable heartlessness the same  the anticipations of a worse future and of the doom that would then visit the empire the same  the supplies both of food and charity the same may we hops that the forgetfulness and want of provision for the future may not be the same in 1847 that they were in 1741 y the first emphatic notice of the state of things in 1740 and dated the  of January is this   ladies undertake to give all their winnings at quadrille to the poor. then collections are ordered. next we hear of sheep dying and a drought continuing from Christmas to Aprilomens more fearful than presaged the present calamity  then starvation America looked to as now for the supply of provisions  then proclamations issued against forestalls but one measure far more wise and more useful than interference with dealers or their prices was one which it would have been desirable to reintroduce within the last four months   Dublin January 3 1741. his grace  lord primate and other charitable gentlemen of this city in. order to ease the city of the great number of strolling beggars resorting  from all parts of the kingdom and to relieve the trusty necessitous have notified to the governors of the workhouse that they are willing at their own private expense to give one meal each  to every person who shall be deemed by the governors of the house entitled to such charity. and od Monday last the said governors at a mineral board came to a resolution that tickets shall be sent to filch governor now in town that he may distribute them occasionally to all such persons as are obliged. through the deadness of trade and dearness of bread to seek relief through the streets and suburbs of this city. the said tickets are to be signed by the governors distributing them who are to insert the name of the person  the number of children fa his or her family who are directed to go to the workhouse for such relief. u on Thursday last the officers began to give one full meal to all such personas came with said tickets and it is hoped since such provision is made for the poor the inhabitants of this city will discourage all vagrant beggar and give their assistance that they may be sent to bridewell to hard labor and thereby free themselves from a set of idlers who are a sandarac a reproach to the nation. if the present governmen had exercised a test of this kind the board of works would have had the satisfaction of paying wages to the indigent and the industrious not to the idle the disaffected and the buyers of firearms. disease was of course rife.  we hear says the journal ahead   that numbers of people daily die of fluxes and fevers from want of proper food and that there is great snickers among st horses of which numbers die which the poor people eat for want of other victuals  new york and  small towns of a remote province sent  a great relief to the poor  of Galway and limerick. that we have improved somewhat on the former principle of giving assistance though the principle has not fairly been carried out in practice may be gathered from the following suggestion   it is earnestly recommended to every great corporation and private gentleman in this time of distress to set forward some work such as paving fencing draining making roads or canals cleansing harbors c. which would employ all that would work and  the country of strolling vagrants who if found begging should be sent to bridewell or whipped. the common pretense of want of work being removed. corporations and private gentlemen would be at no greater expense by this charitable provision of work they would only employ more hands at this time when the necessities of the poor call for them and ewes hands at other times when the necessities are over  whereas giving charity to those who are able to work without requiring work from them is an encourage men to idleness and a public loss. another incident to the famine of. 1741 finds a mournful parallel in that of 1847. the people on the coast had then as they have now a ready and present storehouse of provisions in the sea. but we read no account of their availing themselves of the advantages which nature had furnished for them. they were content to receive tickets and be fed by alms. that they did not work on land was perhaps the fault of the governmen and the proprietors. but that they abstained from fishing in the sea can be attributed only to their own inertness. as it hap pwned fish in some parts did constitute a great proportion of the food consumed. but it was imported from Scotland Faulkner journal for marsh 1741 menions this   quantities of herrings are come over from fife besides a great deal from Dunr a seasonable relief for the poor. it is computed the boats commonly catch from 20000 to 30000 day each. they sell in fife at from 40 to 50 pence per thousand. so unchanged are the people and their habit within the last 100 years  and what reflections does not this suggest  it might perhaps excite something like a momenary sentimen of triumph to observe that the boasted Irish parliamen and rampant nationality allowed the people to dk into a  so abject and so forlorn. but no feeling of triumph can harmonize with the contemplatino of such gigantic improvidence end incurable lethargy as are exemplified in the present state of Ireland the reproach that we would launch against a provincial parliamen or proprietary redounds upon ourselves. we feel that if they were careless through ignorance we have been careless without ignorance  and that if they sinned from want of warning we have sinned after warning. for is it not a great sin to have left a people multiplied  time to the chances of the poorest and most uncertain root 1 is it not a sin to have enacted no laws and instituted no customs which should correct the tendencies of the Celtic disposition and the habits of a Celtic pop latino 1 we found them ignorant indigent and indolent. have we enlightened them enriched them or in  them with energy i have we strengthened their sentimen of independence  the discipline which has braced the mind of the sturdy  7 or have we suffered them to grovel in the squalor of contented pauperism and revel in the imposture of a beggarly proprietary if we have forgotten our duties we must  content to share the opprobrium of Irish helplessness and Irish want with hat wretched fiction of legislatino the Irish parliamen. but we must not rest here. our penitence will be worse than useless without amendmen. our future must atone for our past. we must educate and elevate Ireland by teaching her people to educate and elevate themselves. the distress in mayo.,"(LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14,

at we are made sensible of e fearful visita from which we are septed by so slight an interval. en it is ate enormity of what we escape and ey endure is brought more forcibly to our minds by e

castrator dear of ose virtues and n.ffecs which enable men to brave naal calamities wit li serenity and success. in our columns of yesterday appeared a letter from a contributor whose playful sae has so often afforded amusement to our readers. but  Jacob dominium  writes no longer from e palatl magnificence of belgrav e fears of precists and e treachery of peel are no longer e emes of his light

Jacob Samnium  may be unfortunate ine scenes  his visifa. all places lady n be like letter brick  all landlords may n be like e mulligan. but why is it at in Ireland and nowhere but in Ireland events

peasantry. but why is it at e former are lost and buriced in e general leaven of eir class y why is it at e latter is so pent for mischief 1 is is only rowing e ques a degree back. e condi of Ireland is n caused by e number of bad landlords or bad tenants. it is caused by at neglectful and ins different state of ingsat want of systemat absence of so.cl regula .wiout which e rich and e poor are ever in a state of mutual hostility Ireland e rich man has been taught to ink at e prior man has no cla upon h. e poor man neglected by e law has learned to vindicate his rights by its infringement. e one extorts and oppresses e her cheats or assassinates e worst effect en of a bad system is us realized. e good sfer for e bad. e tenant demoralized by a sanced iniquity evades e payment of bis rent. his lessor treats his own landlord in e same way  and us many are deprived of e means of practicesing at charity which is at once congenl to eir natures and accordant wi eir sta. on e one hand e peasantry made callous by e afflic of one year and e injustice of many filch from eir landlords eir legal dues and from e land its natural tribute of labor in order to transport e joint accmulas of fraud and posture to some foreign shore or reme province. on e her e landlord irritated by e pride of caste and e jealousy of covetousness blinds his conscience to e wretchedness of his starved dependents and while he stoops to solicit for his own kinsmen  household e degrading alms of english charity shuts his ear and his purse to e wail of destitute industry to e rightful demands of e workout and infirm laborer and cl plaintive supplica of orphan or widowed helplessness. if ere is one class of human beings which more an any her should pray for a poor law wi all eir hearts and souls it is at of e Irish landlords. e present state of ings should be inerable to em. ey should n live one day more under its despism ey should struggle to set emselves free as from an overwhelming burden of obloquy infamy and disgrace. no matter how good ey may be individually eir class is branded wi e stigma of a heartlessness hard as e neer mill stone. it may be often an unjust acc sa  but it is one to which partly eir own folly and partly e folly of e legislature have exposed em. ey have lived arid do live in a state of  which recognizes no dependence of poor on rich  no clas of poverty on pro

before a wholesome state of ings comes round. in  former letters i remarked on e tillage of e land and on several occasions i stated my opinion at cultiva was carried to a greater extent an bad been generally admitted to be e case. subsequent observas continue to confirm me in at belief. wi e excep of a small district to e west of errs where e land seemed scarcely suited from its poverty to any cultiva i saw no signs whatever of neglect. on e contrary ere is undoubtedly more land in tillage an usual. between lerick and Kilmarnock a disrance of 20 miles i could see but nine fields which were neglected and even ese may yet be sloughed n at e land has i believe been so well labored as heretofore  less manual labor has boon expended upon ite lough has n gone so deepe fields have n been dug

Lucius  and  studded at once saw his danger.  studded took him by the arm and s Lucius followed him as closely as possible to prevent him from be struck from behind. the mob shout and yell crowded in upon them and evideny tried to force him towards a small stream lined with masonry where the poor people were in the habit of wash the clothes. if they had once got him into it noth would have saved him but s Lucius and  studded succeeded in keep him off. foiled in the pose the fury of the people increased they mobbed him effectually tore his thick great coat to shreds knocked off his hat and cut his head. at last one man twisted his hand in his neckcloth and almost strangled him. he was so closely pressed upon that he could not raise his hands to free himself and he was sink.  studded perceived the danger but nwither could he get his hands up from the pressure of the crowd. there was noth else for it   studded laid hold of the fellows fist with his teeth and bit him to. the bone. another instant and captain fish bourne would have fallen never to have risen alive but  studdeds teeth saved him the man relaxed his grasp. the mob hen opened a lit some of the police appeared captain fish bourne contrived to get on his car which was in front and the liver succeeded in pmh on clear the crowd and reach the police sta. s Lucius  and  studded both thought at one time that captain fish bournes chance of escape was gone and certainly without the protec he would have been sacrificed sacrificed to the extraordinary report that he was the man who destroyed the people at .  he farmers are not employ the laborers and in this respect there are very contradictory reports. the farmers say the men will not  for them at all that they have been demoralized by the public works. by the bye that expression of the people be  demoralized by the public works  has become a regular catchword  the country all hands make use of it whether they understand its mean or not. on the ohm hand the laborers say the farmers will not he them at any price. if it were possible to decide the question which ii is not i believe it would be found that blame rested with the farmers rather than with the laborers. much discontent pres vials among those who have been removed from the works by the late reducs. it could not be otherwise and the most discontent is shown by those who are least deserv of relief especially by those who were improperly raced on the  this jibb has attracted great atten and met with deserved repro ba in England it. is generally attrit bented to the gentry and the relief com mittens but though these tarries have in repeated ins aces i must ac know ledge followed a highly discreditable course and evinced a sular  tension of the principles by which they out to have been actuated yet more blame has been cast upon them than i think on the whole they deserve. the great extent to which jobb went in this respect has been perpetrated by overseers and persons of that descrip.  from the different opinions i heard expressed i gathered that however individual perils or individual places may have been affected by the late reducs on the works the decided steps taken by the government have met with general approba among the better classes inasmuch as relief committees have been stimulated to exert themselves  the pressure upon  em by the poor people of the immediate neighborhoods it is fortunate too that the works have been stopped for the present at least though many of the roads are left in a . dangerously unfinished state. a great deal of money will be requed to put them in reasonable order to say noth of what it would be necessary to expend if they were to be finished in the anner originally intended by the engineers and sub engineers who laid them out. the fury of the mobs coerced the presentment sessions into pass all that came before them and the necessity of find labor in the distressed districts forced on works which would not have been undertaken in ordinary times. not haveng time to consider maturely how they the roads ought to have been laid out the engineers hurried into the execu of them respective of the probable cost. the subject seems to me to be one of moment and it is my opinion that only those works should be completed which are clearly indispensable to the general communicas of the country  that they should be executed at the smallest cost with reference to common safety wither by rigid taskwork or by contract leav the remainder to be dealt with by the several grand juries to finish or not wholly or partially. as the exigencies of. the various localities may reque. ,CONDITION OF CLARE AND LIMERICK.,1,5/3/1847

subsidence of the distress. leading article Saturday august 14 1847. the people of England are not wanting either in charity or in patience but we are sure they would all think it high time the commissioners for Irish relief should close their account. by the end of September the latest period to be allowed even for the worst conditioned districts it will have been full two years since Ireland was put under the system of extraordinary relief. after two successive failures of the staple crop this is not too much  but with a good harvest actually under the sickle with food no longer at famine prices and with an unusual demand for labor there can be no reason for suffering this enormous account still to run on. of course indolence or cupidity or possibly a still more discreditable motive can always suggest to the recipients of charity t they pave a claim to its further continuance where you have to deal with the sluggish and responding and where the moral is t they are to sit still and do nothing while the state puts into their mouths the bread of the industrious the  inert ire of human nature is sure to back your advice nothing is so easy as to go on for ever giving what is not your own. to this day or at least till the other day for we think huller stopped it at last we were maintaining the widows and children of the french protestant ministers who fled hither after the revocation of the edict of Nantes let extraordinary relief go on a month longer n necessary and it becomes a vested interest. even a beggars walk an be sold. continue rations for a year and Irish property will rise in the market. the fainest prospect of legislative assistance will suspend the auctioneers hammer and reward him with one more bidding. we presume t when the industrious inhabitants of this island made shift to carry Ireland through the famine they did not contemplate t their charity  be coolly discounted and negotiated in the market by landlords and land jobbers. so it is high time the affair should be wound up. we are quite aware t there are circumstancees under which the cessation of extraordinary relief on any plea whatever would be a mere mockery of distress. to tell a starving man t he must starve because he has returned to his normal state which happened to be one of starvation would be a cruel jest. but while we have propped up the nation with temporary measures ne have taken the opportunity of presenting to it a permanent institution of charity. Ireland has now a. real poor law. every man woman and child struck off the extraordinary relief list can go to the relieving officer of the union and claim support from the local proprietors. in fact the Irishman has now the same chance as the Englishman in this respect. the english pauper does not dream of extraordinary relief  nor. does he ask the clergy to put their heads together and send a howl to the news. papers. the english landowner when he finds a few dozen poor creatures pressing on his resources does not make out a. case for parliament or the treasury. no the poor man gees to the parish and the comparatively rich man pays the just debt of charity without more ado. if pays the debit to the uttermost farthing even though the outgoings of his property may be actually exceeding he incoming i he must pay it. he knows t he has no escape. the Irish proprietor must now do the same. yet one of the pleas urged upon the relief commissioners to induce them to con them their rations is  t the poor law guardians lave no funds. were the plea once allowed we may be sure the poor law guardians throughout the whole island would take very good care to be always without funds. ii England we do not consider w ant of funds a   reply to the demands of a creditor. the debtor  either meet his social obligations or resign his whole status in society. he must give up the inheritance of his fathers the mansion which he has built with his money and adorned with. his taste his sweet pleasure grounds and gardens every curve of which has been traced with his eye and his pen his heirloom his furniture his jewels his library and even the portraits of his illustrious ancestors though they seem to live again in his feature she must part with everything and quit for ever his much cherished home a poor but honest man.  and its duties in this island mercy is utterly unknown. the law has not an atom of compunction  it exacts to the uttermost farthing. if one proprietor cannot pay the debt another can. the same rule must and shall be established in Ireland. they tell us t there are parishes where the whoa produce of the land is insuffi to the maintenance of the poor. we to not believe it. but at  rate the experiment must be tried. let the whole produce be seized. when t is done and when all the crops have passed through the books of the parish or union we shall then be in better condition to ascertain the ratio which the resources of the soil bear to the population upon it. .. we mean what we say and are indifferent to the canting charge of inhumanity which the landowners and the landowners scribes will be sure to bring against us.  utter sacrifice and sunder of property to its charitable obligations is by no means so uncommon as it may seem. thousands of yeoman and tenant  in this island have been reduced to beggary by the payment of  we do not say t Hippocrates were the sole or the necessary cause of their ruin  but we do say t when after lives of industry and competence they found themselves aged and penniless they would have been wealthy men if they could have recovered the sums they had paid to the overseer. perhaps they might hate managed with a lit mere thrift perhaps they init have scraped lip their quota for the datebook by the savings of the larder or the beer cellar or by some other painful denial. but so it was. the  was just the last ounce t broke their becks after  for rent and  for tithe  for the poor took the wind clean out of them and kept them continually foundering from one scrape into another. we rave no wish to  class of iibh proprietors or tenants floundering further or deeper u they noel are. we only say t if they find themselves compelled to practice the most rigid economy or even to surfer great loss for the sake of the poor they are only in circumstance s with which we are very familiar in this country. but there is a still commoner and still more painful case. in this metropolis are many thousand occupiers of very humble tenements living by precarious employments with severe toil and  the midst of very great discomforts. instead of blue sky and the balmy gales of spring they dwell madder a canopy of smoke and breathe a poisonous and stench atmosphere t taints the blood and sinks the soul. they would rather live bride heather and bog but the calls of duty and the necessities of life compel them to seek employment where it is to be fund now of these many thousands nearly all however poor themselves contribute to the maintenance of the poor. the invalid many weeks ii arrears the widowed mother t toils all cry at  washing tub or all night at the shirt the struggling mechanic and the pensioned solitary must meet the demands of the quarterly collector. though they go without bread for it themselves and see their lit ones cry for food they must and do pay. in failure thereof they must part with the bed on which they lie and eventually the house itself in respect of which the demand is made. in behalf of these many thousands we peremptorily insist on it t the Irish proprietors and tenants shall have the selfsame measure of duty and shall maintain their poor to the very last farthing in their pockets and the last rood of their estates. otherwise it  inevitably and speedily c me to this most iniquitous and intolerable resultt the overworked and hard pressed ratepayers and taxpayers of this

closing of the relf fund. leading article Tuesday aurous r 24 1847. the day is now rapidly drawing near when the relf fund will cease to be available in aid of any one electoral division throughout Ireland  the 15th of the present month the names of many were struck out of the lists of the relf commissioners. on Sunday next still more will follow  and on sun fay fortnight not en  will be entitled to further assistance. from the 12th of September next Ireland must swim alone the Irish poor must be  supporetd by the Irish soil. there should be nothing disheartening in this proposition for men who are worthy of the name. it is suffntly evident to the eye of any intelligent obserr that throughout those districts of Ireland from which the loudest complaints are likely to arise the soil is at this moment but in a state of half cultivation. take clear take  up through mayo to Donegal walk through large portions of limerick and cherry and compare the state cultivation there existing with that of soils  similar fertility m England and in Scotland what is the reason of the differenc 1 protestant ascendancy answers the prstcraft oppression roars out the welled repealer while the husbandman as he takes a snapshot in  dusk of the ening at his employer thinks it stre that capo al will not remain in the cointry. here is hower another and a better reason behind which is just thistle predecessors of the now nominal owners of the soil were a thriftless and improvident rice and the present generation must ray not only for their own manifold transgressions and shortcomings but for those of their ancestors. at this ry moment a large number of them are living beyond their menus they not only ha nothing but they are deeply invold besides  and yet they consider it a hardship that the imperial treasury will not furnish them with the means of continuing a style of expenditure which is utterly inconsistent  their real condition we are fully aware that the usual answer to this is that the affliction which has fallen on Ireland in  year 184647 has been a speal visitation of providenc unexpected in origin dreadful in effect sweeping in extent. it is as though the windows of hean had been once more opened to sweep away not a people but the only means on which that people could rely for support.  grant most readily that which it would be affectation to deny with the fifth report of the relf commissioners before us that the root which has been the main staple of subsistenc for the Irish people was in the last year mainly destroyed. from that  learn that at the beginning of July upwards of three millions of persons were supp retd on daily rations afforded by the public bounty while op the  of august more than two millions and a half had still no other means of subsistenc the fact hower of the destruction of the potato is quite beside the. real merits of the question. the real point is who brought the great bulk of the Irish people to rely upon that root for support 1 by whose act did it happen that while in tether cointrs of Europe land and labor were settling themsels down into their natural relations Ireland alone presented us with the phenomenon of an unemployed peasantry and an untilled soil there ha been Irish landlords who were a credit to their cointrymen worthy in ery sense of the position they were called to occupy. the white list at the present day is we bel still morn numerous. but when we ha made ery necessary abatement it  remains ft  truth treat the prime cause why the Irish peasantry ha been reduced lo their present lel  be sought for in the neglect and unthrifty of past generations of cleartdrinking writ despising landlords. that is at least one reason why the Irish peasant is  worsted worst clothed worst housed man in Europe  fed upon jumpers clothed in tatters housed in a hol which  dares scarcely thatch lest the torch of the incendiary should be appld to it at mid. night. that is the reason why bogs ha remained untrained acres untilled  waste lands out of cultivation. wit the operation of the pour law will commenc a new era for jell up till harsttime three millions of persons will ha been ssupporetd on public rations who after the sickle  done its work must fall back for support on the products of their own soil. the landlords can no longer flinch from t obligation evictions of tenantry ra had their day but that system at least will  avail. if proprtors in Roscommon shall think fit to turn their arable land now let in small holdings into pasture with no holdings at all they are welcome to cork their pleasanter there is just  enc between their past and present condition formerly they would turn outlr cottrs out to  upon the roadside now they must make a rate for their support in the union workhouse.  would ha them for their own sakes to understand thus much that they may take their measures in time that come ill come good this law will be left to its natural opera  it is in ayin  them to look for furl r aid or subsidy to this side of the cannoli all that we could do we hate done d ready. despite of all the obloquy and abuse of which we ha been the objects we say it in sorrow not in er henc. forth they must help themsels. we  not en disposed to rake up the recent grvances of the abuse of the relf funds although we see by the minute of the commissioners that Irishmen there ha been who ha drin an unholy traffic in the misery of their coin vestrymen we are most loppy to gi all publity to the fact that the commissioners speak of this abuse as being far from unirsal and acknowledge in suitable terms the zealous cooperation of the relf committees in the various districts of the country the question of the poor law and of the absolute necessity of submitting to  provisions is we take it for Irish landlords just now the matter of most vital importance. another question  hower been raised as to the time and mode of repayment of the money advanced to the different unions under the relf art we published yesterday the proceedings of the board of guardians for the union of fermion who hail been called together under a requisition from the poor law commissioners to levy an additional rate to repay the advances under the temporary relf act. the sums advanced by the relf commission are referred to various heads. there are donations in aid of local subscriptions  there are grants in aid of rates  finally there are loans on the credit of rates. it is with regard to a loan under this last head that the discussion arose at the board of guardians for the union of fermion. we find this union debited in the accoint of the commissioners iv a loan of 23829   and it was for the return of this money that application was made. some were for making a rate to repay the loan  others for paying it by installments  others for not paying it at all  while lord  with his usual naite stated his opinion that if y once commencd to pay en by installments they would be opening the door to exaction which would finally rind them down into the dust. the discussion altogether took a turn to which we ha not been unaccustomed from an Irish deliberati assembly.   who seemed to ha forgotten altogether the sums that had been disbursed from the imperial treasury for the relf of Irish distress was of opinion that if the fermion union repaid this loan it would be calling on Ireland to tax herself solely for the relf of Irish calamity. he proposed to call together all the poor law guardians of the cointy of cork in order that they might adopt one uniform mode of action for repudiating their debts in a body.  Carroll with some pretensions to sense and honesty rd erred to lord jinn Russell declaration on the 25th of June to the effect that arrements should be made by parliament by which in each succeeding year money advanced to the Irish landlords should be repaid by installments and when each installment be came due upon one half being paid the other. half should be remitted taking care that the whole debt was kept up till that half was paid. without stopping to inquire too curiously how far lord john Russell declaration was applicable to the rate in question we are content to accept en this desire to meet an obligation as evidenc of a better state of things. in no instance we hope will the loan be remitted  but at the same time there is no doubt that as to the mode of repayment a certain regard will be had to the icumstances of each particular union. there is so deep an anxty to gi the landlords a fair chance with the new poor law which will most assuredly be worked in its full rigor that ery consideration which is consistent with the exact repayment of the loans will we trust be shown them in other respects. the present crisis is the turning point of the future destiny of the landlords of Ireland the. burden of practical proof is thrown upon their to show that the cointry can support their class.,CLOSING OF THE RELIEF FUND,2,8/24/1847

the Irish crops in 1847. letter to the editor Thursday august 26 1847. sir the state of this country at the sent moment cannot but pro e interesting to your numerous readers and as i have just returned from an excursion through the province of ulster i beg to lay the result of my observatio before you. i am happy to inform you that the grain crop is the finest i ever saw and reeling ripe  it now only waits for the sickle to pour peace and plenty on the land. the green crops are equally fine and of a breadth and style of cultivation that i never expected to have witnessed in so short a time and at such an emergency. turnip cultivation is the leading feature of the scene and nowhere did i ever see such crops of this valuable esculent. itead of a few stunted patches as formerly sown broadcast and never cleaned the eye now wanders over vast fields of green luxuriacne without a weed to be seen  the drills well formed the ridges clean and free from foulness and the whole showing the effects of that endless and incessant labor incident to this improved syst of husbandry. the bean crop also looks uncommonly well and it is. much to be desired that this most useful food should be more generally ex tended in this country. coidering the sent state and prospects of Ireland there appears to be 110 crop better adapted to its wants tn resources than peas and bea r none that i would wish to see more generally cultivated. it is a better food for man than any vegetable keeps well is easily pared and cooked and every way adapted to the wants and habits of our poor farmers. with reg to the potato crop it no doubt looks well  and coidering the advacned period and fineness of the season i am strongly inclined to hope . that it is  it now cotitutes what it ought ever to have been namely a valuable ingredient in our rotation system  and i sincerely trust that the experience of the past  sound good . seise of the future will ever keep it from again becoming the sole staple food of a civilized people. sir the state of things i have just de scribed appears to have had a most sal tray effect upon the minds and habits of the laboring population in these dis tricots i watched with feverish anxiety the progress of events on Monday last sharing in the general dread of the sud den suspeion of the late relief system before the possible adoption of the new and dreading lest society should burst its bounds from the ssure from within but thanks to the bountiful munificence of providence the crisis passed off in peace.  prospect of the future was so cheering and  demand for labor so general and immediate that the public mind appeared to have been suddenly appeased and subsided into a state of healthy confidence and tranquillity. everywhere i went i saw the legitimate functio of society restored and jabber apparently absorbed into its proper channels. the fields we full of industrious men and women engaged in their legitimate avocatio. some were reaping others deeply occupied in the cultivation of their green crops  and crowds of little children were scattered over the turnip fields thinning and weeding them and lending their infant labor to the general stock. the appearacne of the laboring population was also gratifying in these favored districots they looked clean contented and happy able and willing to do their  k and cocious of a certain return for their exertion snot like the famished looking phantoms in the south and west that i saw toiling on the roads in April last whose unhappy lot it was to have the punishment of the convict and the felon added to their original infliction without the coolation that their exertio would be beneficial either to themselves or the community. thorough draining has been executed to a coiderable extent in certain places. it is not however genera owing in a great decree to the uncertainty that attended the arrangements at the close of the session before last. it struck me also that many of the localities have not been judiciously selected  traversing large tracts of mountain wastes  indiscriminate drai according to pla laid down in a public office is not in my mind likely to be either profitable or productive and will require a vast and immediate command of capital both in farm buildings stock and labor to render anything like return for the past expenditure. it is much to be regretted therefore that the efforts of the executive were not more generally directed to draining the low lanes already cultivated so as to make good land better and to secure a speedy and a certain return for the outlay. i have ever coidered a general system of tile making as the proper commencement of thorough draining intis country. there is nothing like beginning right and laying a proper foundation  coequently i have always had my misgivings that importing tiles and pipes from England and Scotland at great expee and carting such a bulky material into the central districts can ever pay. it absorbs a great portion of the capital  deprives the Irish bourse and artisan of his right namely the absorption of his labor and exertio where passible upon tile spot. i was therefore much gratified at seeing some of the finest clay and manufactured tiles and pipes from within few miles of Londonderry and was told that there was no limit to the quantity that could be procured for the purpose.  superintendent of  dwellers tile making machine also told me that he never st finer or clay that  more easily worked  the articles were superior to any i ever saw in this country. if  be the fact it is a most important point and ought to be fou owed up at once. the gentry and large proprietors ought to be called upon forthwith nay in fact coerced to establish tile factories on their estates for the benefit of their tenants and neighbors whenEngland became a grain eating nation the wisdom four acnestors also established manor mills on ever estate for their tenants and gued their mutual privileges with the utmost jealousy. and so it is with Ireland at sent. we have suddenly misbecome a. grain couming population and every caution ought to be made at once for securing these manufactured articles to the public with facility and ease. sir i am confident that by the general adoption of a few such  acts as these combined with the plentiful supply of food now almost within our reach the sent crisis can be passed and many of our difficulties surmounted. let  only learn the value of self reliacne of mutual cooperation. let us not be looking to the government and an overworked executive at every hands turn for  acne and relief. no country was ever yet made prosperous or wealthy by acts of parliament. the power of the legislature is limited and much misunderstood. it cannot make a people frugal or industrious the only source of national happiness or wealth. it can remove difficulties it may supply certain wants  but it cat. not and ought not to he cued upon to supply the functio of a nation and usurp those duties which civilized man  imperatively called upon to discharge himself for his existence. the most formidable difficulty i see to contend with for the future is the total want or almost destruction of stock and cattle throughout the whole poultry i appears to me the most alarming feature for the future for i cannot possibly con  how the relatio of husbandry can be carried out or tho new improvements in draining or reclamation can be made productive or available without an increased supply of this essential article. if therefore the stock question be not taken up at once and properly inquired into if the facts be not known and stated and the most vigorous efforts made to supply the deficiency the coequences will be more disastrous than any we have yet experienced. but on the whole sir i feel confident from what i have seen that the darkest hour of any is already past and that the crisis is over in Ireland. many great impediments to social improvement have been suddenly removed and a spirit of mutual cooperation now appears to  vail which never before existed. let us then enjoy the sent calm in reviewing the past in order to gu agait the future. let our pla be pared and matured and without confidence or despair be suited to the wants and resources of the country. we have many favorable elements tour command many happy combinatio and i think i may also say with the unanimous coent of all parties that we now have a respoible head to our local government every way calculated by age abilities and experience to reconcile and direct these various elements and by their judicious direction to relieve the sent wants and develop the future resources of the country. your obedient servant Dublin aug. 22. edw

local pleas for nonpayment of loans. leading article Wednesday September 8 1847. the great Irish difficulty in the course of its protean transformations is resolving itself into something of an ordinary character. from almost every union in Ireland we hear that portentous announcement so familiar to the ears of all who happen to be in the way of giving trust to the  they are not able to settle the account.  of 130 unions we believe only eight confess to any money in hand. there is a universal demand for more te under ccumstances which assure us that delays are dangerous. in many districts it is computed that the rates under the new poor law will swallow up all that can be pos sibyl scraped from the people and that nothing will be left for the liquidation of the late  loan  and in not a jew particularly  districts it is gloomily pronounced possible to feed the people even if the rent be altogether sacrificed. although there is doubtless an amazing degree of exaggeration and downright invention in these statements et we cannot doubt they cain a substratum of truth. we cannot avoid the conclusion that Ireland will find it very difficult to repay even a moiety of what we have lent and that the whole strength of the country will be taxed for the fearful burdens it has now to undergo. nor can we doubt that there is much honest unaffected genuine insolvency. nor again  there any reason to doubt but on the crary we are most happy to know that almost everywhere in the midst of this region of landlordism there exist a few righteous men who do the duty and just save t1e class if not from the judgments of heaven at least from the unqualified censures of man. of course there are other objects to be considered than the duty of a fa estate. that alone however is embarrassing enough. where is the man who has discharged his conscience on the subject of Ireland  has not seen reason to revise and amend his judgment before another mh has exped every side of the question presents itself in turn with a force absolutely overpowering. an Irish pauper who dates his letter from that Ireland of Irelands  reeks county of forgives us that view which certainly possesses preponderating attractions with the people of England viz. which lays most on the shoulders of the landlord. read the letter and how true and familiar it sounds  how clear it seems to ring i we are not speaking of what it proposes but what it tells and  it is possible to doubt a realtor who speaks with such splicity ind force and whose statements unfortunately tally with all we know or are likely to know. but rub pend your judgment. and  part cm the landlord or some one who has found a good stratum of landlords undertakes the defense he describes them as poor struggling men rare Nantes in turgite vast who in the midst of difficulties sufficient to break tho highest spit to craze the hardest head drain the fullest purse and cross the finest temper have nevertheless kept nonstandard still proudly breasting tho waves of social misery and strife. we may grant that this is true also. surely there must be some good landlords in Ireland else what would long since have become of the class there is unquestionably the greatest possible difference between districts and men. nowhere has this fact been brought out with more ccumstance and force than in these columns.  tes is the only British authority which has ventured to embrace the whole surface of Ireland in one review having at the same te the temerity t discrinate and show the good and the bad in the proper relief. if at. any te we have seemed to relapse into vague generalities it is only because Ireland certainly does present itself in one sple character with some pervading attributes. Ireland demands repeal. Ireland begs. Ireland is excused dect taxes. Ireland lives on potatoes. the potato fails and Ireland . suffers famine  Ireland comes on the easury for assistance. ten millions are borrowed at great loss by an embarrassed people and advanced to Ireland. half.  it is given to Ireland. the chief spokesmen ofIreland threaten that the five millions not given but only lent will not be repaid or if repaid at all will be so very slowly indeed. it is natural to personify an agent which acts and speaks with so energetic a uniformity. we talk therefore of Ireland Irish landlords and Irish peasants not as doubting there are some exceptions to the rule but merely taking the facts in that almost unvaried splicity in which they are actually presented to our senses. what renders it still more difficult for the english to discrinate between the sheep and the goats of the Irish flock is that every post brings over a Bridget of news consisting of little else than pudent repudiations of debt and savage abuse of the British benefactor. Ireland we really cannot help spanking of her  sucking tb very blood of England for these many mhs returns much the same thanks to the people who hae suffered and are suffering for her sake that a wolf would return to the man who should be sple enough to draw it out of a pit. there is hardly a British operative who is not pinched in his wages there is hardly a British tradesman who is not pinched in his business by the unparalleled sacrifice we have made  give er lend what we could to our Irish fellow subjects yet here is the mail gain as the last mail and probably the next bringing over brutal invectives and insolent disclaers of obligation. there may be much of a crary character in Ireland but why  it not crive to make itself audible and also influential we are justified in suspecting an interrupted silence. if Tralee should Larry its point by effrery it could be so much in the pockets of all the landlords of Ireland. they would rather of course that others did so dty a job. but so long as they let others be the spokesmen of Ireland they must be cent to take a share in tho scandal. should these spokesmen succeed 10 are sure  is not a landlord in Ireland who will refuse his full share in the profit. it is for the Irish themselves to establish any distinctions they may wish to feel. there are repudiation and nonrepudiationg states in America let the nonrepudiationg unions of Ireland hasten to disavow the share in this baseness. let the landlords come forward. the guardians of Tralee are fighting the battle of the landlord. in this question the board of guardians wholly consist of landlords and the sques. it is the interest of them all to make the spinners of Manchester the weavers and stockings of Nottingham and the laborers of dorsetshe maintain the Irish poor. whatever can be filched from the  peril treasury will find its way into the pocket of the Irish proprietor.  j. O'Connell hself ls doing landlords work when he shows such anxiety to thrust out the paupers of his country upon the shores of this island. it is for the Irish proprietor themselves to clear the own characters. the tenants the priests and the demagogues of the country are involving them in the sins of dishonesty and ingratitude. is it with the own free will and consent  if it is the silence is intelligible if it is not let them speak out betes.,LOCAL PLEAS FOR NON-PAYMENT OF LOANS,2,9/8/1847
horrors of the exodus to Canada leading article Friday September 17 1847. the great Irish famine and pestilence will have a place in that melancholy series of similar calamities to which historians and pts have. contributed so many harrowing details and touching expressions. did Ireland possess a wrr endued with the laborious truth of Thucydides the graceful felicity of Virgil or the happy invion of de  the evs of this miserable year might be quoted by the scholars for ages to come together with the sufferings of the p up multitudes of Athens the distempered plains of northern Italy or the hideous ravages of our own great plague. but time is  improving on the past. there is one horrible feature of the rec not to say the pres visitation which is irely newline fact of more than a hundred thousand souls flying from the  midst of the calamity across a great ocean to a new world  int suffici   jor a footing on a deck and a  in a hold omitting  to these worse than prisons while their frames were wasted with ill fare and their blood infected with disease fighting for months of unutterable wretchedness against lodgems without and pestilence within giving almost hourly victims to the deep landing at length on shores already terrified and diseased consigned to encampms of the dying and of the dead spreading death wherever they roam and having no other prospect before them than a long continuance of these horrors in a still farther flight acrosss forests and lakes under a Canadian sun. and a Canadian fro stall these are circumstances beyond the experience of the Greek historian or the lateen pt and such as an Irish pestilence alone could produce. by the end of the season there is little doubt that too immigration into Canada alone will have amounted to 100000  nearly all from Ireland. we know the condition in which these poor creatures embarked on their perilous advure. they were only tying from one form of death. on the authority of the. Montreal  health we are enabled to state that . they were allowed to. ship in numbers two or three times gretlter.than the same vessels would have presumed to carry to a und states port. the worse horrors of that slave trade which it is the boast or the ambition of this empire to suppress at any cost have been reenacted in the flight of British subjects from their native shores. in only ten of the vessels that arrived at Montreal in July four from cork and six from Liverpool out of 4427 passengers 804  died on the passage and 847 were sick on their arrival  that is 847 were visibly diseased for the result proves that a far larger number had in them the seeds of disease. the larch says the board of health on august 12  reported this morning from Sligo saltily with 440 passengers of whom 108 died on the passage and 150 wire sick. the virginium sailed with 496158 died on the passage 186 were sick and the remainder landed feeble and tottering the captain mates and crew were all sick. the black hole of Calcutta was a mercy compared to the bold of these vessels. yet simultaneously as if in reproof of those on whom the blame of all this . wretchedness must fall foreigners Germans from hamburg and Bremen are daily arriving all healthy robust and cheerful. this vast unmanageable tide of population thus thrown upon Montreal like the fugitives from some bloody defeat or devastated country has. been greatly augmed by the prud and we must add most necessary precautions. adopted in time by the und states where more string sanitary regulations enforced by severer penalties have been adopted to save the ports of the union from those very horrors which a paternal governm has suffered to fall upon Montreal. many of these pest ships have been obliged to alter their destination even while at sea for the st.

fighting propensities. leading article Tuesday September 8 1847. n is now some years since trial by wager was formally abished in England a young woman had been murdered with the greatest atrocity. the murderer was brought to his trial and nody doubted the issue. a clever fellow of an attorney however had rummaged up an obsete statute and when the accused was called upon to plead he demanded another sort of trial viz a personal combat with the nearest relative of the deceased who happened to be the poor girls brother a puny and sickly young man. there was no alternative but to admit the plea and the ruffian escaped. the statute was immediately annulled. now we are almost disposed to ask whether this wasn't done in a hurry. legislation ought not to be much in advance of the times. it is open to a question whether trial by wager  of being a step backwards would not be a positive improvement upon the existing practice of Ireland in that country there is a sort of natural foundation for the appeal.  there is in fact a stan ding appeal to arms. and undoubtedly arms do often decide the controversy. the question therefore is whether what is now done illegally roughly and foully should not be done with fairness and semnity. in trial by wager there are spectators umpires rules and invocation of heaven. that of course is an improvement on murder and on the numerous gradations of menace and insp Renee which derive their only force from the circumstance that they point more or less closely to the possible commiscion of that crime. last Wednesday night in the county of Limerick a man was eating his supper by the fire with a child in his arms. an armed party came round his cottage fired in at the windows and door shot the man dead breaking the silds legs and fled over the g. of course it was a quarrel aut land. if the man had been allowed to exchange a shot with the principal murderer. he would at least have had a chance of his life  and perhaps this would have satisfied all the instincts  Milesian equity. possibly too. the  armed party though they rather liked tb fun of discharging all their pieces into a family circle gathered round a turf fire would live been glad to sneak out of a combat face to face and one at a time. the  guardian gives us another example to the point occurring near Newport there was a quarrel abut some cattle and their keep. the owners of the cattle were driving them away when the servants of the man who had undertaken to keep them interfered to get back the quadruped lodgers. the servants were armed by their employer and of course used their weapons. one of the two brothers that were driving nay the cattle received a ball in his back and will probably die. elsewhere an agent of lard Shannon with a large party were executing an Haber and taking poss scion of a house as lest they  one of them was ordered to get on the house and strip the roof. the first slate he removed he fell dead to the ground by a shot from the occupant there is all the difference in the world between the last two cases. in the latter there had been considerable vience  the feelings of the manslayer and ho was one against many. he fought against odds and faced his danger. it is clear however that a trial by wager would have settled th affairs much  there would hate been a bit of romance too aut. them instead of that ugly gallows look which with our prudish Silas of equity and law they must unavoidably wear. but we are forgetting a case vastly snore to the purpose than any we have mentioned. the people in the Cooperstown union last winter were or pretended to be in much the same case as the rest of Ireland they had their wheat and their barley but lost their potatoes.  the legislature offered them various kinds of assistance which were all thankfully accepted. . one of these kinds was an advance under the  temporary relief act a sort of provisional poor law to be applied till the permanent measure could come into operation. when it was passed a declaration had been recently  that half the enormous expenses incurred by the  relief works  would be undertaken by government. and time allowed for the repayment of the rest. an estimate also was made that of an aggregate ten millions advanced to Ireland half should be given half lent. large sums were given outright and as a set off against them as well as for obvious reasons of justice it was decided and enacted that Irish property should refund as soon as possible the whe of what was advanced in the particular form of temporary relief of destitute persons. there could be no mistake aut it. any child who can read the act of 10 victoria cap. 31 will see that it has not one word aut either giving half the money advanced or postponing repayment. on the contrary the act proceeds some time without saying a word of advances and only authorizes them in the case of ready money being wanted when they may be made on the security of rates. what rates i the rates of the next six years  no  on the security of rates  made or aut to be made or as the margin expresses it in.  course of making and clecting. the guardians of Cooperstown union not having money in hand rrowed under the act. it is now their duty to make provision for the repayment of the whe in their next rate. hey decline to do so  and instead thereof modestly propose to wipe out half with the sponge and pay the rest by six yearly installments nothing could be cook than such a proposal excepting perhaps the manner in which it is enforced. the Irish poor law commissioners on being informed of this resution find themselves obliged to put in force an enactment which orders them to suspend the refractory ards of guardians and appoint paid officers to clect rates and repay the advances in doing this however they write to the defaulters and point out their dishonesty in rrowing money on certain conditions and the moment the money is got and spent throwing the conditions to the winds. one point also they bring out which it is particularly important to notice as we are sure it will tend to counteract a rathe. extravagant imprescion which prevails as to the utter poverty of Ireland and the overwhelming burden of this years levies. they remind the guardians that the amount of the rate required to repay the whe advance does not exceed ls.  in the pound in any electoral division of the union an din one division is as low as  in the pound  while if the guardians own estimate of  in the pound for ordinary expenses is correct they would not have to make a higher rate than  sd. in the pound for all purposes in any electoral division  in one division  not more than ls.  in the pound. now we in eng land do not think that so out of reason for a very bad year. nay we have many parishes which pay every year famine or no famine at least twice as much. on receiving the letter announcing their dismissal and containing these fruitless appeals to their sense of honesty the guardians immediately answered the commiscioners with challenge. as there are twenty guardians and only three commiscioners we do not know how the affair is to be arranged on the usual plan  and therefore we are inclined to suspect that the guardians have in their eye rather the case of the  armed party  who poured a broadside into one man with a child in his arms at knock sentry than a  little exchange of bullets at twelve paces. however that may be there can be no doubt whatever as to the particular and only possible purport of the intimation for merely suggesting to the guardians that when mom is rrowed under certain conditions of repayment it is proper that those conditions should be observed the offended guardians tell the commiscioners that in doing so they have taken advantage of their official position to use language to a public ard which in a private capacity they dare not use to them as private individuals. this of course is meant to smell of powder and to brand with the stigma of cowardice those who do not take it in the sense of the writers. lest too we suppose the affair should drop through the want of individuality aut it and the multitude of the challenging party one peppery fellows  w. particularly given  conclude to repudiation and pists subscribes his name with a protest against the inadequate tone of the letter. nor is this all. while  the satisfaction due to a gentleman  is demanded from the commiscioners a still more body threat is held out to the lords of her majesty treasury. a sort of roc kite notice is indited and posted to downing street announcing on the authority of those who are possibly able to fulfill their own gloomy predictions that if an attempt is madetevy the rate a system of resistance will be originated which at future periods it will be difficult to sup press. trial by wager is the only sort of justice we see that will satisfy these gentlemen. to be sure a duel between a debtor and a creditor is not quite fair as in either case the creditor comes indifferently off. if he kills his man he kills the debt with him and he does not get paid by being shot himself we should not be surprised therefore to hear that the lords of the treasury and the commiscioners of the poor laws decline stan ding fire. they who handle the pen may justly plead that they are not adept sat the pist  and men who can strike a quarters balance with wonderful exactness are seldom competent to snuff a capable at twelve paces. in fact hair triggers are not a part of the public service. but could not a corps of champions be organized 1 places are wanted for the promising scions of the aristocracy. there should be more patronage at the ministers disposal than our grinding economy has left us. instead of making young honorableness precis writers and attaches let them be trained for Irish field service. in that case when a ard of Irish proprietors rrow money and attempt to bluster out of the reckoning by telling her armrests public servants that they are not gentlemen we shall have a dy of champions whom we can better afford to risk and who living or dying will do honor to their country. a single duel or a tournament will then settle the question of payment and even if the country loses the money there will be at least no more trouble aut it.,FJGHTING PROPENSITIE_S,2,9/28/1847

Charles and after a minute inspection of all the various deparents we are happy to learn expressed his entire satisfaction with the complete and admirable arrangements of the whsle esestablishment. we visited  and propose briefly to state what we saw. the emigrants are landed at a temporary wharf above the terminus of the machine canal. they are carried clear past the city and sent up  barge as they arrive to windmill point thence the healthy are forwarded as fast as possible to machine on their journey westward. a continuous barrier between the landing place and the canal is erected and on the canal itself the bridge is carefully guarded by police who prevent any unnecessary communication with the city passes being given to those who really have business with the hours specified both for departure and return. a road by the river conducts to the old emigrant sheds which  also completely fenced in and used only for the temporary reception of the healthy. of this large pile of buildings one is appropriated to the children of emigrants lying sick at the hospital. about 120 are there at this moment who are well fed and attended to and taught to read and write so far as practicable. if their parents survive they are forwarded with them  if left orphans they are consigned to different charitable institutions. so far there is neither cause nor can there be any reasonable apprehension of in fetation from the Montreal pilot sept. 11. we are happy to say that the mortality at the emigrant sheds is abated still the diminution is nearly as much attributable to want of material on which to work as to a general improvement of health. the inmates of the hospitals are now lit over   the daily rate of mortality varies from 12 to 24. would we could congratulate the country that proper measures had been taken to provide for the misery and destitution which super added to the ravages of disease are to be apprehended in the ensuing winter  but we hear of no such timely provision and what is to be the fate of our unfortunate countrymen who have betaken themselves to our land to relieve themselves from the miseries entailed on them by injustice and oppression at home god only knows  surely on our executive a serious responsibility rests and if they have not in a voice of thunder demanded from the British government the means of support of those poor  been thus unfeelingly cast forth unprovided to  bide the pelting of the pitiless storm they have committed a crime to which their former misdeeds are as dust in the balance. we do hope that this neglect of a sacred duty is not to be added to the black catalogue of their offenses from the Montreal courier slept 6. we have received this months number of the British  science from which we extract the following paragraphs. we are happy to see that there is a decrease in the mortality in this city  judged by the mortality reports and general professional experience the health of the city is improving although the ratio of deaths from fever is still inordtely high. for the last  weeks the weekly returns of mortality from that cause alone are as follows   June 19th 3  26th 4.  July  12  10th 56  17th 53  24th 60  31st 68.   august 7th 37  14th 40  21st 36  28th 31.  other prevailing diseases are dysentery and diarrheal the former of which is more than usually prevalent this season. from all accounts the sanitary state of Quebec has not improved much  typhus fever introduced by the. immigrants being remarkably prevalent  while at gross isle though matters seemed to be improving the mortality among the immigrants is still immense. on Sunday the  at 10  there were 2048 patients in hospital and the deaths for the week ending the same day at noon were 228. at the emigrant hospital point st. Charles on the 30th of august there were 1198 sick  and 20 deaths took place during the preceding 24 hours. now however that the temperature of the air has become cooler we may participate a more healthy condition of both the cities. from the Toronto patriot. the following is the presenent by the grand jury at the last mayors court. it deserves a careful perusal   city of Toronto home district to withe jurors of our sovereign lady the queen on their oaths present that in obedience to the charge delivered by the court at its opening they have conferred together on the subject of the large pauper emigration from the mother country to the province this season  the amount of sickens and mortality among the emigrants  the extreme helplessness of the large majority of them and the arming prospect before them on the near approach of winter from the want of means for their support the want of employment by which to maintain themselves and families and their general bility to labor on account of their want of a knowledge of the commonest arts and occupations of life even if employment were provided for them. in all parts of the province to which portions of the emigrants have been dispersed severe sickenss  accompanied them to an alarming extent  hospitals have had to be erected for their special accommodation boards of health established and large expenditures incurred for their hospital attendance and medical treaent and support beyond the ordry disbursements for passage and rations while proceeding to their several desttions and the cost of erecting or renting houses for hospitals. these expenses the grand jury are given to understand are borne by the home government and defrayed under the immediate direction of the boards of health at the different stations. but there is no provision made for the support or employment of the patients on being discharged from the hospitals.  are allowed to roam at large either to beg or starve and instances frequently occur of their relapsing after being discharged and returning from the country to the city to resume their places in the hospital. in Toronto some of  humane citizens have formed a society for the relief of the widows and orphan of deceased emigrants but the means at their disposal are very limited being derived entirely from the voluntary contributions of the benevolent. it must be obvious that this laudable effort will fall infinitely short of what is required to meet the trying emergency. it is very evident that during the winter the cities and towns of the province will be inundated by thousands of these unfortunate people unless timely provision is made for their employment and support in some way or other. to allow them to become a  on the public charity would be mist unjust towards the industrious inhabitants  nor can it be expected that they would quietly submit to such an imposition any more than the inhabitants of the cities and towns in great Britain for whose relief special provision has we understand been made by parliament in the authority recently granted for sending the pauper emigrants back to their parushes in  there to be provided for by those upon whom the burden of their support ought legitimately to fall. in the united states the iii flux of pauper emigrants is effectually prevented by the laws of that country so that the whole of them intended for this continent find their way into the Britishnorth American pro vines and chiefly to Canada indeed cases have occurred of emigrant ships having been refused landing at the port of the united flatmates on account of the poverty and sickenss of the passengers and they were therefore driven for shelter into the British American ports where the poor emigrants who survived were landed. nearly 30000 souls nave already passed the port of Toronto this year  and there ar at present upwards of 1100 patients in the Toronto hospitals besides the widows and orphans in the asylum humanely provided for them numbering about 200. the fund as yet collected for the support of this asylum falls considerably short of  far too small a sum for the purpose and it is by no means pro babel that a sufficient amount will braised by voluntary effort to carry the es establishment through the winter with the great increase of inmates that may be expected to flock to it. severe sickenss and death have been of frequent occurrence among the attendants at the hospitals caused by the unceasing labors imposed on them among the hundreds of fever patients with whom they are continually intermingling. sickenss also prevails extensively throughout the province caused in many instances as we are informed by contagion from diseased emigrants ind too frequently termting fatally. the grand jury deploring these cir cum stances feel constrained to call  attention of the court to them and by this means they trust also the attention of the proper authorities so that timely relief may he provided against the al palling calamities with which we are threatened on the approach of winter. i 2 they cannot countenance a proposal to tax the inhabitants of the city for this purpose. already the amount of taxation imposed for civic purposes besides the school tax is as large as the corporation would venture to inflict or the inhabitants can well bear. the powers of the corporation go no further than ls.  in the pound for ordry taxation and the rate now imposed is ls.  in the pound exclusive of the school tax leaving but  in the pound to reach the uost limit. the grass annual revenue arising born the present rate is about  independent of the school funds  and were an additional rate of  laid on being to the full extent of the powers of the corporation the amount to be realized from it would most likely fall far short of what would be required for the support of the great number of pauper emigrants who would be induced to flock hither from the knowledge of such a provision being made for worthwhile the imposition of such a tax for such a purpose would manifestly be as unjust as it would be burdensome and intolerable to the inhabitants of the city.  neither can the grand jury see upon what principle of justice the support of these pauper emigrants can  made a charge upon the revenues of the province. they are not aware of any grounds that can be urged for burdening Canada with the support of the poor of the British isles who ought to have been maintained  their own parushes at home or if sent from home who ought to have been sent with proper provisions so as not to prove a lad and a Emden to those among whom they have come and a shame and disgrace to those by whom they were sent or who permitted them to leave their own shores in such a state of helpless wretchedness. the visitation is one of extreme hardship both to the unfortunate emigrants and to the province  and the grand jury feel that they would ill discharge their duty did they abstain from freely expressing their sentiments regarding it.  it becomes a very delicate point to  any course to be pursued under such trying circum stances  but the grand jury in obedience to the invitation of the court would respectfully submit that the necessary funds for the emergency ought legitimately to be supplied by the home government. and they would further respectfully suggest that the mayors and presidents of police in cities and towns and the wardens of districts might with propriety be placed in funds by government for the employment and support of indigent emigrants at the discretion of the government  that the product of the labor of the emigrants would be accounted for at its fair value to the government and the funds to be set apart relieved to that amount. the able bodied would be obliged to work or want where work was offered to them and the frail and disabled only be permitted to subsist exclusively on the government bounty. he grand jury would also respectfully state to the court the . gratification it affords them to bear testimony to the activity and  of the Toronto board of health and the very efficient manner in which the arduous duties devolving upon them have been discharged.  hf grand jury present herewith a report from the galere on the state of the goal and beg to call the particular attention of the court and the proper authorities to the facts therein disclosed and which the grand jury are aware have been repeatedly brought under consideration by many previous grand juries.  all which is respectfully submitted.

it before us for any given period but it is said .at it is eir owl fault and originates in an erroneous and improvident system  suppos it to be so are we to allow thousands to die of starcation because ey were enabled by providence to subsist previously for almost ages on an  e only oer argumen against ex extraneous relief is at e country ought to be called upon to make sacrifices to relieve itself  at e property of Ireland must support its poverty just maxim under ordinary circumstances and one at has been adopted by e legislature in e provisions of e new poor law. at law be duly carried out will compel all who can contribute for e support of e poor to do so in proportion to eir means and will reduce e demand on oers to what cannot possibly be met by at provision. e extent. of e effect of e loss of e potato in Ireland however is still not perfectly understood particularly as affects all whose income was dependent on e land up to e greatest proprietors. e great mass of a dense population spread over e face of e country lived as is well known on e potato. a family once located on from one to ree or four acres of land was provided for  a cabin could be raised in a few days wiout e expense of a sixpence i e potatoes at e cost of a very little labor supplied em wi a sufficiency of a food wi which from habit ey were perfectly content  and a pig or wi some a cow or donkey or pony and occasional labor at a very low rate of wages gave em what was requisite to pay a rent and for such clo and oer articles as were absolutely nieces  and which wi a great proportion were on e lowest scale of human xis tenace e foundation of e whole how ever was e possession of e bit of land it was e one and e only one  absolntelynieceserentconsequently was high and generally well paid be e

led to e encourage men of early marriages large families and a rapidly increas population  aryl at e same time afforded e proprietor  very good return of profit for his land.. we can hardly wonder at e continuant of is improvident system as it has been called. e entire loss of e potato in 1846 rew is whole class into absolute destitution  whatever little means could be obtained went for food

perhaps a pony and a cart and two or ree pigs. eir farm was of e most slovenly description and eir sell produce after pay eir rent afforded a little better clo and a little more of comforts an enjoyed by e cottiers. still e main stay was e potato. wen at went every else at e disposition of is class was required for food and wi a great number was insufficient  e paymen of rent was not only impossible but all e little stock and. oer means for future continuance of eir habitual occupation were disposed of  and a great number of is class were added to e absolutely destitute. here again is experienced anoer fall off  for ese constituted e lower ratepayers whose contributions for support e poor can not only no longer be looked to but who will emselves many of em add to e number of paupers to be supported. e extent to which ese two classes were affected by e loss of e potato may be estimated by e numbers at it was found nieces to furnish wi mere food for many mons in 1847. which at one time amounted to 3000000 individuals. it is usual to confider e property in Ireland generally as fairly chargeable wi e remedy for e result of is calamity after e first help hand given to it but it cannot be so adjusted.  all parts e evil has been felt but in some much more intensely an in oers. on all e eastern side of Ireland from nor to sou e proximity to e english markets induced a greater  cation of produce for barter and ere are more farmers graziers c. nide pendent of such an article as e potato. alough ere  mixed up wi em a large number of cottiers  but even ese latter have in some degree more resources in available means for e application of eir labor. ese districts erefore tally reasonably be required to make e jl81jes sacrifices to struggle rough e difficulty and may comprehend perhaps fourfi of e country but lie remain  fifat along e west of Irelandremains in a most deplorable condition and has not wiin itself e possible power of relief. e west of Ireland is far removed from markets and it would require e judicious application of much capital and under more favorable circumstances an Ireland has yet afforded to raise it from its late condition of mere selupportxistenace e consequence has been at ese western counties are almost entirely occupied by e cottiers and small holders above described not only s from eir backward state as regards e production of particleboard barter but encouraged by anoer casual circumstance in e nature of e coast which be in deep gul and inlets supplied em wi an abundance of sea weed which applied to e land was peculiarly favorable to e pro propagation of e potato. hence e great body of e people ere are now wiout food and e few above em wiout e rents which could supply eir only means of reliev e rest. in oer countries one interest may come to e relief of anoer  e farmer may relive e manufacturer and ti merchant and vice versa as e case requires it  but in Ireland ere is but one interest be at in e produce of e land. it may be assumed perhaps at e people hav now gone rough e periods of dear of e last two years ought to be sufficiently provided for by e abundant produce of e present season. undoubtedly e especial hand of providence has been us mercifully extended towards e relief of e people in a manner at will greatly mitigate e general distress but it still leaves a large amount absolutely requir a great extent of human and humane exertion. .alough e potatoes have succeeded better is year tan on e two former not above opesix of e usual quantity has been planted and at not by

letter to the editor Wednesday October 13 1847 removed system which it will be  interest and spirit is with feelings of no slight satisfaction t i see now daily evidences through the english press t the english people are beginning rightly to appreciate the true cause of the  poverty  of the Irish it is a satisfaction to me because i may pardonably hope t the seed which when in Ireland i labored to sow through your cumns is at last beginning to bring forth fruit. for some days past letters have appeared in your cumns from many clergymen of the church of England expressing a unanimous feeling of indignation  th should again recalled upon to sicit alms from their congregations on behalf of  the poor aud starving Irish  and your paper of this day contains a long letter from sir j. Burgoyne deprecating t burst of honest indignation at the impudent appeal and putting forth some reasons why there should be a further contribution of alms from England to the poor and starving Irish but confined locally to places on the western coast. to have refused eleemosynary relief to a distressed people when those among them who were in want could not obtain food by law from the community of those who had enough and to spare whilst the law punished them as criminals if th took t food by force would have been a manifest cruelty and injustice. the common principles of humanity and equity forbade us to stay our hands  and however much our judgments might deprecate the means of relief employed it was contrary to our nature to compel or permit helpless people to starve. the legislature has however at length remedied t wrong  it has granted a first installment of enlightened legislation to Ireland respite the determined opposition of Irishmen to the boon and has at length declared to be law t first principle of equitable rule t while it professes to enforce obedience to the laws which protect property it at the same time will not suffer men to be tempted by want bond human endurance to break those laws but will give them a right if in destitution to sufficient relief to support life from the comstockery of the local community having advanced thus far in the  lied government of Ireland appeals to our humanity for the poor and starving Irish  no longer have any just foundation. we have a right to repel the claim as it is now being repelled  nay more when the true causes of t  poverty and starving  conedition of  the Irish  are beginning at length to be in some degree appreciated in England industrious and painstaking and enterprising Englishmen who  earn their bread by the sweat of their brows have a right to re riel the claim with indignation and scorn. sir j. Burgoyne in his letter of reasons for giving assistance to the Irish thus truly describes their conedition   the great mass of a dense population spread over the face of the country lived as is well known on the potato. a family once located on from one to three or four acres of land was provided fora cabin could be raised in a few lays without the expense of a sixpence  the potats at the cost  very little labor supplied them with a sufficiency of food with which from habit th were perfectly content  and a pig or with some a cow or donk or pony and occasional labor at a very low rate of wages gave their what was requisite to pay a rent and for such clothing and other article as were absutely necessary and which with a. great proportion were on the lowest scale of human existence. the foundation o the whe however was the possession of the bit of land. it was the one and the only one thing absutely necessary the rent consequently was high and generally well paid being the first demand  all mon received in order to secure t essential tenure and only what re  became applicable to the other objects. although of the lowest grade it was an easy mode of subsistence and lea to the encouragement of early marriages large families and a rapidly increasing population  and at the same time afforded the proprietor a very good returnable of proft for his land. we can hardly wonder at the continuance of this imp evident system as it has been called. he then proceeds to describe the   edition of the small farmers of 20 to 30 acres of land and says their arming was of the most slovenly description and their selling produce after paying their rent afforded a little better clothing and a little more of comforts  n enjoyed by the cottiers. there are nine and the counsels of such appear unfortunately to have prevailed in the government of Ireland upon whom all opportunities of observation are thrown away. there are men who cannot read human nature though the index point never so plainly. there are well intentioned men who by a kind of perverse ingenuity or impenetrable stidity will stumble on the most mischievous remedies for any evil. what ds all this painfully faithful description of sir j. Burgoyne indicate but the universal prevalence of contented laziness and apathy and want of enterprise among st the Irish people a few days  labor without a  sixpence expense procures the Irish cottier his cabin   a very little labor supplies him with a sufficiency of potats for food with which he is  perfectly content and  occasional labor  pays his rent and buys his clothes  what  and is the Dorsetshire peasant and the suffk laborer to whom twelve hours of daily labor the year round scarcely affords sufficient bread and who has more n once within recent reclection been rendered desperate by the insufficiency of the pittance of  week the price of his  to pay  or  rent for his cottage and to provide bread for his family to be asked by his clergyman to contribute lii mite for the poor and starving Irish who live habitually contented with the cottages and the food with which  a very little occasional labor supplies them   the response is th are starving.  cannot now starve by law there is wherefore an end of t plea. but it is said th are wretchedly poor and distressed. our answer is let them work  we do and their poverty  become ivealnd their distress will be changed into abundance. but it is replied  give them time and th will work better presently give time to a people to untar1ly crease the amount of their e bout who for ages have  been content  p live on potats i the propositioning on the face of it a contradiction. potats re got with  a very little 1a.bout  little more labor vuntarily given would have procured them a better jqoclrflllia.v..e made the slovenly ........ farms yield a better return would in fact have been the first vuntary step out of poverty and wretchedness towards comfort and independence. but t vuntary step has never been taken. why  because the Irish people preferred poverty and wretchedness and dependence with a very little labor to comfort and independence and wealth with hard work. and it is expected t th will take t vuntary step now if we ml subscribe alms enough to provide them meanwhile with a sufficiency of food l oh admirable insight into human nature oh perfect conception of the Irish character  it did require in times past  a very little labor  to procure them the most wretched subsistence wherewith ..th were  content   give them t subsistent without any labor at al land think you not t still therewith th will be  content   it is apparent t if  a little labor  would procure subsistence to an Irishman hard work to which Englishmen are accustomed and to which for the sake of the benefits which accrue to them from it th vuntarily yield themselves would have procured something bond mere subsistence  the continually accumulating value of which surplus production over consumption would long since have changed the poverty of Ireland into  wealth. and it is as apparent as Irishmen were  content  with a wretched existence procured by  very little labor t the necessity of doing something for existence was alone the spur to t  very little labor  for when the necessities of the merest animal existence were supplied the  very little labor  ceased th were content. with a mud hut and potats. it was the spur of necessity alone t drove them to  a very little labor. the necessity was small  the labor was proportioned to it. it has pleased god to visit their land with a famine in  particular kind of food. their land with industry will grow abundance of all kinds of food far bond anything t the land of England will yield. the spur of necessity to labor by the providence of god which ought in truth to be regarded as a blessing has been increased to the people of Ireland. if the labor of the people urged on by this necessity be given there is no shadow of doubt but the return will be sufficient for their wants. but experience teaches us t th will not. vuntarily give this labor without the spur of necessity  their  contentment  with mud huts and potats with  a very little labor proves this. what then do  our mistaken humanity propose to do 1 with a stupid blindness to the character of this people under the name of  charity to the poor Irish we would thwart the providence of  would lighten t necessity under the pressure of which and to meet which th alone will work we would in fact cast the greatest stumbling block t the most perverse ingenuity could devise looking at the character of the people towards the progress of the country out of t slovenly cultivation  and t misery and wretchedness with which and little labor the people are content we would degrade them into  contentment  with subsistence on charity. but it is only the people on the western coast says sir j. Burgoyne who will want this assistance those on the eastern coast from their proximity to England have a market for their produce are better off and can pay rates. the people on the eastern coast are better off because th are more industrious and th are more industrious because th have among st them a large admixture of men of english blood who have transplanted among them the characteristics of their race industry and enterprise. the qualities wanted to make the people of thill west of Ireland as prosperous are simply industry and enterprise. will giving them english alms and supporting them on charitable donations promote either of those qualities 1 th will take our alms and live thereon in  content. one other step by the legislature in the right direction will leave the west of Ireland without the shadow of an excuse if it ds not progress at equal pace with any other part of the united kingdom. once let the legislature facilitate the transfer of land and the sale of mortgagor estates once let them admit men of capital to the responsible ownership of the soil and get rid of the present helplessness of nominal landlords without power of receivers in chancery taking the responsibility of the lords of the soil and of absent and irresponsible capita lists oo mortgagees carrying off without return or care the usufruct of the land and the opportunities will  afforded for the development of industry. at present and i d not speak as a mere theorist for i have been over every part oft from  head in Donegal to cape clear in cork the west of Ireland is a disgrace to the British empire for its neglected capabilities and its poverty and wretchedness in the face of every natural advantage t can lead to wealth. there are to be found neglected the finest harbouts magnificent rivers and an almost continuous succession of lakes affording natural water cartilage of the cheapest kind unlimited water power rich and discovered mines thousands of uncultivated acres and a sea teeming with fish. the harbouts are unfrequented  the Shannon impesses you with melanchy at its vast and deserted expanse  the lakes are unused except by an occasional surfboat no waterwheel betokens industry  the minerals are unwon  the land is a dreary looking waste while Cornishmen almost alone fish the coast in the sight of the  starving Irish what surely here is wanted but enterprise and industry among the people to win the wealth which so temptingly in cites them to labor  yet what must we propose to deaden their impulses to either butt support them on charity  oh let every man who loves Ireland sternly refuse to advances to her one penny and compel heron spite of herself to do more n labor a very little to convert into many sources of wealth her almost boundless natural advantages  and let every softhearted Englishman impelled by his humanity to contribute a sovereign for the relief of  the starving Irish feel assured  this t he has contributed towards the removal of t necessity which will alone impel the Irish of the western coast to work and in so doing has helped to perpetuate their poverty and wretchedness and their de . grading  content. . pray excuse this long letter impelled by your paper of today from one who as your former  commissioner  in ire. land had perhaps unexampled opportunities of studying the character of its people and whilst admiring their virtue of not being blinded to their faults  and believe me to remain very faithfully yours t. cam bell foster. the temple oct. 12 1847.,"(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1847:)",3,10/13/1847
Irish emigration. leading article Thursday October 14 11347. of the many trials to which human nature is exsed we can imagine none more severe than to set an Irish proprietor to write on the subject of emigration. there is something so delightful in the idea of a good human current setting strong from an estate up to the neck in mortgages and men rates and rent resisters that it makes a landlord almost beside himself with longing. his land of promise flowing with milk and honey is British America not of course for himself as he still cleaves to the fleshts of Egypt but for his tenants and squatters. if heaven indeed should please to take them that would be the most satisfactory of all ssible events  but as heaven does not often take a million at a time Canada or indeed any place either beyond or at the bottom of the sea will do quite as well. were the Canaan for oneself one would not be content without actually getting there  but where it is for others as in this Instamatic a few trifling casualties on the way a few thousand starved or rotted or drowned do not much signify. in fact if the whole indigenous pulation of Ireland were simultaneously to pack up their kneading troughs and  off for Canada we are inclined to believe that the landlords having the fate of pharaoh before their eyes would not order out their chariots and try to bring them back. such of our readers as perused the rert of the committee apinted by the lords on the subject of colonization from Ireland will recognize in that really very clever and interesting document the coulee de rose we are speaking of. one could almost imagine that a religious questionless was involved in the matter and. that the writers were a committee of  moths elders setting forth the saving efficacy of a journey to  there are indeed some  ugly rumors of happiness not wholly unmixed and order not wholly undisturbed on the banks of the st. Lawrence only  years since we had to reconquer the colony. wherever the Irish constitute a majority as in Newfoundland they give us on that minor theater a repetition of the performance which has won such applause on the boards of old Ireland. in the united states there is rather a strong feeling on the subject and the union is alms  asunder by the con  between the Irish and their bitter opnents. the most serious aspect of the mat for is its effect on the security of the British character of our American ssessions may Canada long be ours  may we long ssess the northern and the eastern shores of those magnificent lakes  may there long be a place not quite as far as the antides and in a better neighborhood than caff res and cannibals once removed where British enterprise may find room to expand British verty may find a retreat and British disapintment a new start in the race  how long  that continue the case when three fourths of our American colonists shall be of Celtic extraction the produce  a continual outuring of Irish calamity and when nothing but a river full of steamers shall separate the colony from an ambitious neighbor perhaps actually at war with us in every quarter of the world 1 the Irish proprietor whose letter we give in another plume exemplifies the almost morbid jealousy with which the class regards anything that can ssibly check the great Celtic migration. nothing can be less tithe purse than his sermon to its text. we last week called the attention of our readers to the very unworthy characterof British colonization and urged every rational attempt to make the colonies true children of the parent society like in privilege aud rank like in prospects and wealth. to elevate the colonies by all the meas at the dissal of the legislature and the crown seemed to us the most kelly method of attracting thither the rank the education the capital the enterprise and in their train the pulation of these. islands. unless Canada for example could be made thoroughly British in conedition in tastes in habits in institutions and even in prejudices as well as in name and  lamentable but most instructive  dents justified the apprehension that it might not long be ours. we then adverted to the unparalleled character of this years migration from Ireland an army or rather a flight of a hundred thousand souls driven over the ocean by famine and  homes or employment or any other preparation for their settlement. we sad of them in the merest pity and with reference to the misery of their lot  instead of that enormous immigration representing in any degree whatever the wealth tho education tho rank the habits the loyalty and the whole character of the mother country they are to a man from the lower orders of Ireland. that we presume cannot well be died it may be our lack of information but we certainly have not heard of many gentlemen of fortune many  Irish proprietors many savants  or scholars many right honorableness many persons of taste and refinement many gentlemen distinguished for their public services among those hundred thousand. we very much question whether there was even one substantial tradesman or  large farmers in the number. we shall be only too happy to be assured we are wrong. continuing to speak of the hundred thousand persons of whose sufferings we have lately read such heartrending accounts we said  they  they carry with them misery and degradation a visionary temperament and a factious religion a deep sense of injury and a burning hatred of tho British name. we then d welt on the horrors of their passage their disembarkation the gigantic lazarettos in which they there perished by thousand sand the still further calamities which awaited them on their dispersion into the interior. it was natural to inquire after this  what else is to be expected than a demoralized and disaffected pulation a lost colony and an aggrandized rival and whom have we to thank for these inevitable results   on this text tho  Irish proprietor  writes a rather warm epistle. does he however deny our statements or attempt to remove our apprehensions 1 no  he lorn not dispute a word. he ventures indeed on a greater misrepresentation. he says we  abuse the  or emigrants. if we bused anybody we abused the British government and that state of British society which induced such lamentable events as the emigration of this season. he says again that we would shut both England and the colonies against the Irishman and intimates that we wold leave him only gromwells alternative. that is not only unfair but wholly at variance with the letter and purrt of what we wrote. we wished that the Irish should be drawn rather than driven to  rank wealth education and such invariable ingredients of .British society should if ssible be associated with numbers verty and ignorance. if what we call society is a real and a happy thing  if gentility is not an imsition and knowledge folly  if the conedition of England is better than the con edition of Irelandand it is worth Irelands while itself to be wealthier then certainly a multitude of a hundred thousand small farmers cottiers laborers aud mendicants fleeing across the Atlantic within half a year with less preparation and providence than any such number of wanderers ever enjoyed before is a very great and an ominous misfortune. it bodes no good to England. that unhappy multitude lands under evil auspices. all the blessing it carries with it is  your room rather than your company. it owes nothing to the country it leaves. it cannot but remember the story of its banishment. do we  abuse the or emigrant  in all this as the  Irish proprietor  alleges 7 no  we pity and befriend him. we ask for an improved system of colonization worthier of the British name. then why does the  Irish proprietor call us so angrily to account i because by holding up the dark side of the picture he ears we may discourage emigration bis jealousy for the character of the  or emigrants we really believe to be nothing more tau anxiety to get rid of them. he is anxious to size the oprtunity which we willingly afford of publishing the generally successful and respectable career of the Irish settler. bis collection of evidence on this int however is perfectly gratuitous. we never denied that when the Irish do settle in Canada they almost invariably get on well. we have said on a former occasion that though they do not at first make good agricultural servants they do better as independent settlers than the english laborer trained as the latter  been only to service. but many of the Irish do not settle anywhere  they become  callers or navigators and exhibit in that employment much the same peculiarities of character as at home. many of them pass through to the states and become violent liticians particularly when England is in question. this is a result we should do well to anticipate if we can. but the  Irish proprietors  quarrel with us is that in our attempt to procure some improvement on the existing practice we have exsed its miseries and thereby committed treason against the interests of the landowner.,IRISH EMIGRATION,2,10/14/1847

letter to e editor Friday November 5 1847. sir you probably will b good enough to w e following facts to appear in your journal as it is but just at e true position of e landed gentry of Ireland should be placed bore e British public at is important crisis. an overwhelming population has grown  on eir estates in nine instances out of 10 in Opposition e attempts of e landlords to res tram it. two causes have created is state of ings first e generation of landowners who lived 60 and 80 bears ago let eir farms in large tracts to persons who were en substantial yeomen. ey grazed ese lands but when corn reached an enormous price during e revolutionary war ese yeomen subdivided ese farms ad  ese second class tenants again subdivided eir lots until e country in many places became cut up like France into farms or lots no larger an pocket handkerchis wi a consequent increase of e population. e landlord had no power to prevent is system  e head tenant had a lease and could do as he liked wi his own   which he did wi e vengeance. an Irish farmer provides for his sons and daughters by giving em so many acres of his farm as marriage portions. is is eir custom and until e system can be prevented by time and perseverance an estate cannot be placed in a healy position. where a lease stands against e landlord  is powerless  where it expires he is called an exterminator  if he endeavors even to buy out e petty occupants and increase e size of e farms he is resisted by all e chicane of e law and probably shot into e bargain. so much as regards e middlemen as ey are termed.  in e second place e population has increased prodigiously . from anoer cause e priesood remove eir. moneys from e dues paid em by e lower classes  ese dues  consist of fees payable at Christmas sld elater on marriages birs dea confessions purgatorial payments and many oer roman caolic ceremonies. consequently it is e interest of e priesood to encourage early marriages by every means in eir power. marriages in Ireland and subdivisions of land are synonymous. between e middleman wi a lease and e priest e landlord is in serious predicament  he has Avery difficult task  perform and one which requires daily attention and vigilance coupled wi extreme caution or e results  be fatal from ese two causes have arisen e fact at ere   in Ireland whom no one knows what to do wi or whier to send or how to keep from starving now at e potato has become degenerated. e ree king  groan under e weight of e expenses lately incurred  it is almost an impossibility to counteract ese evils exclt by a system of emigration on a large scale. drainage and oer improve ferments in agriculture will only be an adjunct e population can never be supported by ese measures alone. e position of e great mass of tb landowners of Ireland is is over two irds of e country ey are owed from a year and a half to two rears rent. e farmers hae reaped a plentiful harvest which ey . have well atched in eir. haggard and will not sell it intending to pay eir landlords little or noing ere is a widespread combination or confederacy formed from one end of e country to e oer generally speaking to draud e landlord of his just rights on e same plan of action which was resorted to in e anti tie war. e same opposition is carried on by e farmers against e payment of taxes for e county cess as well as e poor rates. e laws of e land are died by an armed population who have become a drilled bandits e lowest ruffians are armed ey plunder every one ad Librium and ere is no law to disarm em. e landlords have been disunited from eir tenants by e hourly exertions of e priesood and e agitators whose sole object in so doing is at ey may wield e masses at elections and  to parliament ose precious. specimens of legislators who are sent over to London to represent Irish constituencies at. is e  abuse of Irish landlords  ey are to be mfr . dilated because e great majority of em are Protestants attached to eir religion and

abolished sees  e meantime e poor rate in its mitigated state amounts to a tax of 20 per cent. generally. is proportion falls on e landlord at is very moment besides oer county charges for previous

under the tender care of the Irish court of chancery it had been very badly manege with. an immense pauper popula  and it is said  arrear of rent. the manager had for some time been threatened. the tenants refused either to pay rent to till the land or to give it up. it was the plain duty of a proprietor to check a stall of things fraught with misery and death to the still increasing still impi perished mass. accordingly mar mason last year assisted many to emigrate leaving the coast clearer for  t remained. at the expense of  he chartered two vessels and sent obit a number of his tenants to

Dublin  4. an incident took place yesterday in the office of  murphy one of the masters chancery which strongly illustrates the disastrous effects of the utter insecurity of life and property in this country. a fee simple estate consisting of  acres of prime feeding fond with an excellent Westinghouse advantageously situated in the county of Roscommon was put up for sale at  for the first bid being scarce one half of the instantiated value of the property. while the sale was proceeding a gentleman got up and addressing those about him spoke of the dangerous neighborhood in which the estate lay remarking that it iwis close to the spot where only the night previous major mason fell by the bullet of the assassin. the announcement created a powerful sensation in the office and a chilling silence d a minute or two succeeded. the master at length interposed and having severely reprimanded the speaker for his intrusive observations ordered the sale to proceed but it was to no purpose. the blow had struck home  and after an offer of  or something like four years purchase the sale was indefinitely postponed. emigration as a remedy for Irish poverty.,LANDLORD MURDERS.,1,11/6/1847

let tell  the editor Saturday November 131 1847.  letter lately appeared in your that view leas also appeared  i hope you paper fm tb  manager of a fishing will   me by a few facts  at Valentin the purport of by myself ill tent neighborhood with ch was to show how much more pfit the last two months to attempt to.  ably the funds at the dissal of the some further light op this  i .

Valentin fm ch place your correspondent dates his letter there has bell long in work an extensive slate quarry manufactory employing at times many as 1200 men. 1 h we before me letter fm the manager and principal sharehder in that work to the effect hat long as gratuitytous work is distributed cannot pcure labor at the same price as heretofore and consequently those works must be contacted again dingle ch is the principal fishbowl on that coast there are about small boats of one sort and another with fm six to eight men depending for subsistence on the working each boat. in the first week of September i spent three days at ding lethe first two days were limy and tho boats not go out the third day was  fine day for fishing as any in the year and mackerel and pilchards wore reported vessels that had seen the shoals in  about the bay to be very abundant. my great surprise i observed that more than 12 boats had n out that morning and on  the cause found it to pe strictly and sely tho flowing beg Saturday a double allowance of soup was to be distributed  there was also an expectatn of a gratuitytous distributn of meal   it  a regulatn that the applicatn for  soup and meal should be made in  days fishing was thus sacrificed. the experiment of ch  Benetton the manager has excited considerable  and expectatn in that part of the country but its principal resu hitherto has been to show tho impracticability of intducing foreign capital with any pspect of adequate return so long the labor has to compote with idleness though that idleness be assocted with the barest subsistence even. a chance of subsistence. such is the dispositn of the Urh to depend on charity and gifts that no amount devoted to auth purposes could satisfy all  where ne is satisfied  are disappointed  no  can  he recklessness s  ch the  m the southwestern districts  cast to the winds certainty to be obtained by  the merest chau of the barest subsistence to be obtained by begging without feeling that the charity ch has been so slavishly contributed to save life indirectly by its inevitable inadequacy to meet all expectatns has been the means of destying life many well informed persons belie that fewer lives would have been sacrificed if not one penny had been given gratuitytously. however that may be the moral mischief that has been done to the survivors seems to ad of but two remedies   one is to jet starvatn take its course until such as are capable of g instructed shall take warning and recover their reason sufficiently to see that their only hope of life is in finding work  tho other is to employ what remains of the charitable funds in pviding such work as shall pduce in the most direct manner food encl subsistence at the same time that it will aid in teaching them the salutary lesson that life depends upon hour there is doubtless much more difficuy in administering a fun cl in this way than in gratuitytous relief  but surely this ought not to be an impediment would it not be well worth le to devote a portn of the fun cl to raiment for such additnal care and attentn than that the whe fund should not only be saorifed encl lost but might become the means though remotely of sacrifing more of life and happiness than it immedtely eaves 1 lore is no lank of precedents to justify tho British assoctn in setting apart a portn of their fun cls for repductive purposes such as fishing. in 1786 a society called the British society raised  for the impvement of tho fisheries of Scotland and the resu of their opetns may bf aeon in the now flourishing town of  and other towns and villages established by them   under the name of tho repductive loan fund fm a charitable subscriptn like the present and it is by a sum of  advanced to the government out of that ind that the curing statns wore established on the west coast of Ireland at the endow last year. and it appear s tat the Highlander relief oomtee have already adopted a similar course by applying what remains of their fund 1 i believe about  to the extensn of the fisheries. the mangers of that fund allowed no imaginary difficuies to stand in the way of  obvusly wise and beneficent plan and determined at once to obtain an  of parlment to sanctn such an appprtn if on further consideratn it should appear inconsistent with the objects of the donors.  can it for one moment be supposed that any contributor to such 11 fund would object to the testees availing themselves of the experience of the last year in the appprtn of such portn of the fund as remains in hand  strictly speaking the fund was subscribed for the tato failure of  the  as it appears to me would live been perfectly justified in closing their accounts ut the end of that perd and reporting to their subscribers the balance in  in reserving this  for the exigencies of the forthcoming winter they are clearly taking upon themselves an authority ch was not perted to them by the subscribers. the appeal to the public was for the  relief of extreme distress in remote districts then prevailing  is it not quite reasonable to assume that many of the subscribers would positively objet to the extensn of this relief to another season the circumstances and causes of the distress g in the meantime completely changed may not the diminished subscritn1 under the queens letter be attributed impart at least to a consideratn that it was no longer expedient to  the people of Ireland by gratuitytous relief surely sir sufficient has been done to uphd the character of this country for charity and genesity quite unparalleled may we not now be perted to take a more deliberate and calculating view as to what may be the best mode of preventing such calaies for the future t what eecty have we that the pota.ts will be planted next year 1 how are people who are to be fed gratuitytously this winter to be convinced of the necessity for their relying on their own exerns for the next the present distributn is no longer a sden and overwhelming

agriculture in Ireland lead article Thursday December 30 1847. the practical instructors in agriculture who at the suggestion of lord Clarendon were recently appointed to traverse certain districts of Ireland have already commenced their task. we publish today letter from a gentleman who. has every means of acquaint himself with the result of these operations and as far as his report goes it is good. there has been no doubt a good deal of burly contempt displayed in certain districts for these emissaries of civilization. Plutus was looked for and Triptolemus is ill received we have often thought it a pity that for their own sakes Irishmen could not be deluded like the old mans irons in . the. fable. the story goes that a certain man a landed proprietor was blessed with a fine family of sons. his estate was so large that it sufficed for the wants of the family dur his  that but a slender portion of it should be taken into cultivation.. what was enough for one family however was not enough for twelve. the old man got uneasy about the future fate of his sons. they were goodhumored idle jolly fellows more constant attendants at wakes and merrymak than at the loughs tail. if any one of them ever gave the future a thought it was but to repose on the conviction that fortune would stand his friend. one idea formulary enough was common to them all that when matters came to the worst and the black ox had put his hoof upon the foot of any one of them he would be relieved from his difficulties by the discovery of a pot of gold upon this hint the old man on his deathbed acted. the fable is too well known for us to transcribe it at length. the dy father told the young men who surrounded his bedside that with his own hands lie had dug a hole in a particular spot on the estate and had deposited in  pot contain the whole or hf personal property converted into bullion for the occasion. that which reason could not accomplish was effected by imagination. their father gone the young men dug and they delved they sloughed and they harrowed. they found no direct treasure but they obtained what was more to the purpose white crops and green crops and  and swedes in great abundance. such was the realization of the old mans promise. not one but each of his sons discovered the treasure and each appropriated to his own particular use the pot of gold. now could we persuade the great bulk of Irishmen that in some one province of their island there lies buried a bill which has received the full assent of queen lords and commons and which  other ths provides that there shall be granted to Ireland ten millions sterl per annul for an indefinite period with a large percentage to the fortunate finder we should convert them at once into the most industrious nation on the surface of hearth the landlord and the  the priest and the thug would shoulder the spade in concert and the soil of the country be turned up as the Irish soil never was before. the will laborer would not indeed light upon the bill but they would find their country teem  with the fruits of the earth in due season and soon be ready to acknowledge that the results of steady industry are better than a godsend or a windfall. lord Clarendon has done the best he can to persuade the citizens of his  Sabbatarian to set themselves honestly to work in the only way which promises anyth like success. as is well observed by our correspondent the  has seen that the only way to save the struggl farmers of Ireland from ruin is to rouse them to exertion at the crisis of their fate. it is no golden shower that would avail them in their need even if the clouds which yield such rain had not long since been drained of their supplies. what would be the result to the people themselves if the governmen were to persevere in a system of almsgiv and public works it would be easy to foretell. the moneys thus disbursed would be charged upon the unions and every shill of pproperty in Ireland rateable to the poor rate would become the subject of confiscation. we would then for their own sakes impress upon such of the Irish public as have anyth to lose by taxation the fearful responsibility they incur when they throw difficulties in the way of any scheme to rouse the farmers to exertion. the people of the three kdoms will differ in the end that is very true but the first victims will be the very men who are an impedimen to improvemen. the factious and discontented in Ireland cannot reach the public in general but through the sides of their own countrymen. there have been also forwarded to us reports from the practical instructors in husbandry which in themselves perhaps convey the fairest idea of the state of the west of Ireland as far as agriculture is concerned. we take two or three instances at random.  martin was appointed to . visit the baron of errs in mayo. re thus describes part of his progress through the district. on the 20th of November he assembled some of sir Richard smells tenants and instructed them in greencropp and particularly turnips. we would call the attention of those who assert that no practical benefit is to be derived from the mission of these inductors to the next fact recorded by  martin. he describes himself as point out to his audience a field of turnips sown broadcast on ridges which was completely lost for want of proper cultivation. they told him they knew no better. they had never tried to grow turnips before. is lord Clarendon then so far wrong in the estimate he formed of the ignorance of the people in agricultural matters i  martin describes himself as pass the day after he had indoctrinated this audience with the theory of turnips through a large tract of waste land which might be easily reclaimed. it has gravel banks so convenient he writes  that boys with wheelbarrows could easily gravel ten perches a day. noth is done the Irish agtor would tell you there is a want of capl. the gravel and the boys however are there..  Walsh another of these instructor gives us a very sad account of the condition to which the poor people are reduced in the neighborhood of Ilyushin clear he saw crowds of laborers and small landowners with their children wait for admission to the workhouse although so backward was the agriculture of the country that they might well have. been employed. when it is asserted that the want of capl alone and not the want of skill is the cause of the estrange men between the people and the soil we find from these reports that the facts are not so. the peasantry and small farmers frankly confess their ignorance of the pro ceases of agriculture and show themselves anxious for improvemen. this may bi said to be the general spirit of the reports we have received from mayo  Connemara clear cherry and Donegal lo their honor be it spoken the roman catholic clergy have in general shown. themselves ready to give every assistance in their power to lord Clarendons1 emissaries. lord Sligo has adopted  opposite course and gives as his reason his strong conviction that the mission of. these instructors will not be attended. with any practical benefit to the people.  we have repeated it over and  again we look for no miracles from this measure of the lord lieutenant we look for no miracles from any measure that can be devised for Ireland her ad vancemen in civilization  be the slow growth of years developmen of a germ that already exists. you cannot import civilization as you would guano.. the czar peter tried the experimen in Russia and the result of his laborious Diderot aptly said was the production of a fruit which was rotten before it was ripe. so it is in Ireland he advancemen of her population must be from the people and of the people. it must coma  from below not from above. it mus be the result of industry ceaseless. effective earnest industry. in a quarter of a century such a course of conduct would reclaim the country. noth else will not even the occasional find of a. pot of gold,AGRICULTURE IN IRELAND,2,12/20/1847
the value of an Irish poor taw leading article Thursday describer 23 1847.   h. Grattan has proved hself on at least one occasion since the meeting of parlment a sensible a moderate man. it is on that acnt we are concerned he should attempt to damage the character a operation of the present Irish poor law a enrage his ntrymen in the extravagant demas on the perl treasury. that law as it now stas is a step of incalculable portance  so much so that unless we are mistaken it will hereafter be thought to compensate for the horrors of  the great Irish famine. n has a sufficient resemblance to our own to promise silar results. putting perfections out of the question a admitting that the Irish as well as the english poor law might be better we still say that both are infinitely better than the barbarous a inhuman denl of all public charity which Irela till lately exhibited. it is a regular system a insures some beneficl results besides the mere relief of distress. certainly nothing has contributed so much to the present state of english iustrl society as our poor law  a if Irela is ever to be made like Engla that will be one of the means. one obvious merit of a compulsory a effective system of charity is that it makes up for absenteeism a for the moral defects a disabled finances of iividuals as a general rule lalordism is absenteeism. throughout the whole of these islas the instances in which lalords reside are the exceptions to the general fact. the owner of the pash seldom comes near it. he resides at his seat twenty or two hured miles off a is to be fou either in town or at Brighton or abroad or in the highlas or anywhere but on the soil whence his income is derived. even if he did or ld reside the example of Irela warns us that he might witness starvation two hured yards from his stables or his kennels while his horses a dogs were consuming good christn food. in Engla however the poor law comes in to set all this right. out of ev thousa pous that would otherwise go to the lalord a never be heard of again the overseer lays an embargo on one hured or three hured or if necessary more for the poor. hence the burden of poverty does not fall excursively on the resident a the ki. the main expense is equally shared by the absentee the pitiless a the spethrift. were the. lalord left to hself he would perhaps se a note in reply to the portunate demas of the clergyman a expect to see his name figure in the nty  in consequence instead of  however he pays  a that long before he receives hself one sixpence of his rent. whatever the lalord may think fit to give is in addition. one thing too is v  larger the  the ignore is got out of the absentee. we have no wish to see h or any man pluered in the name of charity  but if tho poor happen to be numerous a there ae v large demas then a good poor law is the only engine that can effectually reach h. it was then a singular perversity of reasoning that led  Grattan to assign absenteeism as an argument against a good . we ld scarcely believe our eyes when we saw it stated so broadly as he put it at the last sitting of the house  the compason between the burden of the poor rate in Engla a Irela was scarcely fa considering that so much money was carried out of Irela by the absentee lalords in this ntry. if they sent back the money taken away by the rich proprietors the Irish would be as able to pay poor rates as the english were  but after taking away the rich proprietor a exhausting the poor proprietor who remained it was rather unfa to taunt Irela with paying  in the pou while Engla paid ls.  if they did not take care of the operation of the outdoor relief clause in the poor law bill the Irish resident proprietors would be brought to poverty a distress a the result would be that they would come over here as the french refugees did after the revolution a we should have to give them a shilling a day to maintain them. now in what other way can we se back the money taken away byte rich proprietors so effectually as by a good poor law  the Irish orators tell us that  or even  are annually drained from Irela in the shape of rent. we suspect that they possess v few data for that estate  speak v much at raom. taking the lower sum however we have half the malleable value of Irela carried out of it as  Grattan says by the absentee lalords who however do not reside by any means exclusively in Engla but are also to be fou in shoals at pas at  a elsewhere.  Grattan is as iignant as we can be at the spectacle a cries out  se us back the money. we do se it back. how in a . the collector whatever his Irish title may be stops the money at the agents gate a takes out of the bag the poor mans pence. it is idle then to urge in the same breath that prel cannot maintain its own poor because its fus are insufficient a yet that the absentee  six or eight millions. here is a plan for taring half that money or rather half that value of Irish produce a detaining it for the poor. yet we are told that an Irish poor law is only feeding a hungry dog wish a joint of his own tail. a moiety of  is something more than the  of a dogs tail a in the present instance it has already been detained from the absentee a a poor law reunites it to the hungry beast. or rather when the absentee has the tail of his prey already between his teeth we compel h to a partl surreer of the mouthful. but says  agitation the Irish resident proprietors will be brought to poverty anil distress by this law. how  by a law whin compels the absentee to share with the resident the cost of humanity the grievance however is in the amount. hitherto during the v few bears there has been a poor law at all Irela has usually paid. about  in the pou while Engla has paid ls.  we are faking  Grattans figures. is it then an intolerable hardship to ruin a  bring h to the dogs to drive h into banishment a make h a pauper if we exact from h ls.  in the pou on his rental why thes   left which is no despicable change out ofay sovereign. but what if other rates a charges ran the drawback up to  in the pou then 1 in the pou on the gross rental is   fa net income. but  orderings answer fully meets the complaint a is perfectly true   with reference to the remarks which had been made respecting the different ratings for the poor in Engla a  la he begged to say that in tho 27 pashes which constituted the borough he represented Aylesbury the average poor rate was  in the pou. hear hear. he was quite certain it was as high as   in his own pash. when the Irish gentlemen were rated to that extent it would be te enough for them to come over a ask his  l 2 constituents to contribute to the relief. hear. in other words fst try the poor law. see what it will do. levy the same rates that we do in this ntry. make all the recipients who can work work for the money. when you have done your best then let us see what more is wanting a wherein the law is defective. it will then be te to see what supplementary measures may be requed. but so long as the  is only a thd or a quarter of what  paid with tolerable cheerfulness in this ntry it is sply ridiculous for the Irish proprietor to cry out  oh murder   ruined  we do not give ourselves up for lost sply because the overseer comes upon us for a seco nine penny rate in the year. be re of,THE VALUE OF AN IRISH POOR t.AW.,2,12/23/1847
agricultural instruction in Ireland letter to the editor Thursday December 30 1847. sir the success which has attended lord Clarendon practical instructors in  in fact the only cheer prospect which i have yet seen in the disastrous history of  followed up might lead to the most important consequences. amid all the revolt accounts that reach you from this country it is satisfactory to see one movement prosper in the right direction and mall though this effort may appear at first yet i trust i shall see it offacially rcognized and become one of the permanent institutions of the land. it appears that there are now 10 of these practical instructors engaged in the remote. and helpless districts of the south and west of Ireland where the locality evidently could not contribute to the expense their services are free and whee the proprietors of any particular district subscribed one half for the purpose the council of the royal agricultural society contributed the other half and provided competent person to act as instructor. by thee means the interest and cooperation of the locality have been secured and active and efficient men established under the control and direction of headquarters. the cordial reception which these men have almost invariably received is strong evidence of their utility and of the demand for their exertions  i refer with pleasure to their reports by which it appears that they have been everywhere well received by the roman catholic clergy who gave them every cooperation and assistacne. this is decidedly the most important feature in the movement and when it is considered that this is the first time in which practical instruction has been tried among the remedies for the social evils of Ireland it is gratify that the attempt should so favorably received and promise to be so successful. there is certain executive machinery in Ireland that if judiciously combined with voluntary and individual exertions might be productive of the happiest sluts  but unfortunately the efforts government have been hitherto conducted with a reckless indifference to the real wants and resources of the country. it is really melancholy to look tack upon the dos of the last two years and to compare the profitless expenditure of public money lar and time with what might have been done if the same had been properly and judiciously directed. the sensible and think portion of the community foresaw all this aid protested against it but unfortunately their warns Cassandra were neglected and passed unheeded by so that the old proverb of   deli rant rages  achieve still prevails and whatever follies our rulers perpetrated . the poor Irish were sure to suffer for them. thanks however to the wisdom judgment and energy of our present viceroy there is some chacne now that these gigantic errors will be henceforth avoided. of an age and experience to qualify him for public business he combines the most active exertions with a natural disposition do what is right and the public feel confident that no more of these disastrous blunders will be inflicted on them from which the and the whole united community are now suffer so severely with that foresight and intelligence which marks the statesman  clares don saw that the only way to rescue the depressed and struggl farmers of Ireland from ruin was to. stimulate and to instruct them to rouse them to exertion at the present critical moment and by one combined effort to awaken them to a sense of their self dependence he saw that to persevere in a system of eleemosynary relief or badly managed public works would only perpetuate the evil and end in the total demoralization of the country  and that the only hope was to appeal to the people themselves and by convinc their understands to force them to exertion. in that attempt the efforts of the noble lord have fortunately been attended with unexpected success. ten active and intelligent men are now employed in so many districts of the south and west of Ireland in stimulat and instruct the farm clasps  and small though the number may appear at first compared to the wants and resources of the country yet it is incredible to conceive the practical and benefacial effects that have been already produced by their exertions. these men furnish reports weekly to the council of the central society and they form without any doubt the most accurate and interest account of the actual state of ths in the brail districts at present. their instructions are to go aut from place to place and point out to the farmers the great advantage to be derived from digg and turn.  their land and expos mg it to the effect of frost dur winter  they also point out to them that they can no longer rely for subsistence upon the cultivation of potatoes and grain alone but must seek by more varied culture to supply those wants which are now become so emergent  and they instruct them in the cultivation of those vegetables and green crops which have hitherto been totally unknown in these neglected districts. it is really gratifythough painful to read the accounts these men give of the state of the small farms in the  of Ireland and the efforts they make to follow their instructions  though almost starv at the present early season and depend in many cases on a scanty supply of roots and vegetables for food they still obey the wall and turn with eagerness to cultivate the land which they never thought of touch so early before. the instructors also state that on their return to any particular locality which they had previously visited they saw evident symptoms of the parties hav profited by their advice and that the land appeared absolutely red from be tuned up which formerly was never touched until spr began. to those acquainted with husbandry the importacne of this process must be manifest and i am happy to hear that it is the intention of the council to retain these men dur the winter months in order that they may be prepared to impart additional instructions to the same parties in cultivat their lands when spr approaches. here then is a system quietly and substantially established that involves the greatest principle connected with the management of Ireland namely the practical instruction of the farm classes and the successful effort to stimulate them to exertion. the progress how ever of this movement will depend en tiredly upon the funds that will be available for the purpose and i know of no project as yet started that so well deserves the confidence and support of the charitable and philanthropic. while thousands are spent with questionable benefit in feed the idle from which no return is received a few thousands may be now judiciously applied at this critical juncture in instruct these same people and rous them to exertion. a few benevolent individuals thitherto contributed most liberally but the fund at the disposal of the council is totally in sufficient to produce any great or  facial effect as 50 at least of these instructors would be required before spr to effect any substantial  upon the helpless and neglected outcasts they have to deal with. i trust sincerely therefore that the noble efforts of lord claresdon will be supported as they deserve th by the state and by voluntary contributions  that the importacne of the movement will be fully 1 cognized and hailed as tho dawn of happier days for Ireland  that while every constitutional effort shall  made to  the wicked and coerce the strong the real causes of our social evils shall not be lost sight of and every exertion made to remedy and relieve them. already a movement has been made from the ards of different poor law unions who have felt the benefits of the system to extend its advantages and to make them permanent  and numerous memorials are be presented to his excellency from these dies call on him to follow up his views as the practical instructor of the .Irish peasantry.. it is to be hoped therefore that these appeals will be attended to and hat justice will be tempered with instruction for it is the general opinion. that if the vindication of the law be not followed correspond amelioration in the social tak advantage of the turn of the tide and domestic condition of the people the which now appears to be at its lowest same endless state of coercion.

remedial measures for Irish distress.  t. c. foster  who  instructed in 1845 as the times comsioner to investigate the condition of the  of Ireland at the conclusion of his inquiries expressed his vie of possible remedial measures in the follow letter  i have just finished careful examination of the numerous letters which i have written to yo from Ireland hav entered on that examination anxious to refresh my memory with the impressions which those letters contained prompted by each locality from which they were written. i assure you that i rise from the task dressed by the almost unvary evidence which they bear of neglected capabilities of want of energy enter prase and industry of ery and degradation. to grapple with these monster evils is indeed a terrible task  but these are the evils with which the governmen must grapple if it hopes to see Ireland no longer a stumbl block and a difficulty alike the weakness and the disgrace of the empire.  want of employmen is the first superficial want which presents itf. it is however a want which is more imaginary than real. employmen abounds  but there is the want of energy and the want of industry to set about find employmen. want of capl to give employmen is the first cry with which you are met. but it is enterprise and industry which creates capl. capl is wealth accumulated  and wealth can increase only in proportion as the produce of the. labor of the community is greater than its consumption. labor is the first price the original purchase money which was paid for all ths.  labor is the source of all wealth. it is then to the want of industry that we must attribute tb want of capl. but the statesman will ask almost in despair row can you make a nation industrious which is steeped in apathy and laziness  it is the business of a statesman to try and the task is worthy of a statesman.  it is at once conceded that the governmen cannot find employmen for a nation. employmen for the mass of the people must spr from the people. that which the governmen can do only is to aid the people to stimulate them to lead them to protect them in find employmen. the question then arises how are these ths to be done 1 i know the appearance of egotism the seem presumption writ to you what may be done to reclaim a people. tire are quacks in abundance each with his nostrum  i may be esteemed a quack. after however hav seen all over Irelandafter hav written on every subject which is talked of in it and prepared laborious details on every subject after hav had no common advantages hav always had the opportunity of mix with the best informed society in each town and county i humbly submit to you the opinions which i have formed. i believe them to be  them  if you find them worthless reject them.  the want of industry of the mass of the people is but partly ther fault. it is partly ow to the natural disposition and partly to ther want of knowledge and the want of opportunity of beige industrious. again the want of knowledge and the want of opportunities of be industrious are faults which must be laid at the door of the middle and upper classes. it is for them to guide and teach those below them and find them the opportunities of industry. strictly speak there is hardly what can be termed a  middle class  in the country look at it as a whole. the middle class man in England is the most useful member of society  along with considerable physical activity and exertion he is perpetually striv with all the energies of his mind to accomplish some useful object which gives employmen and creates wealth. he is either a merchant a manufacturer a farmer or a shopkeeper. each gives his energies and his skill to make the business in which he is engaged succeed. except parts of the north of Ireland and two or three of the principal towns the middle class man in Ireland is what is termed a  middleman a perfectly uess drone ap the manners and habit of the class above him liv on a profit rent which be neither uses skill nor exertion to enable his wretched undertenant to realize. his superior knowledge never directs them. he is of no use in society on the upper class man then falls the duty of teach the mass and find them opportunities of industry. for the most part  upper classes almost en tiredly neglect both  duties. and this fault i partly to be attributed to ther negligence partly to ther embarrassmens and partly to that unhappily prevail system of intimidation which drives them out of the country. however well disposed the mere nominal owner of an estate has not the power to promote improvemens which give opportunities of industry and without the opportunities of industry the people cannot learn to be industrious. however able and well disposed the man who is placed in apprehension of his life will leave to agents the duties of his position and the door for neglect and abuse is at once opened  and neglect and abuse but aggravate the evils which prevail. what measures then would such a state of society dictate to a statesman 1 remember that individual liks and prejudices nay that individual interests must give way to the interests of the nation. we cannot expect improvemen to spr from the mass from the common people  not only is this true of all nations but in Ireland it is contrary to the national character for the mass of themves to improve. they are con tented with potatoes. remedial measures must then be directed to the middle and upper classes must be fitted to meet ther peculiar relations and positions under which now the opportunities of knowledge and employmen cannot arise for from the middle and upper classes must improvemen spr.  of what use is the middleman 1  if he usurp the place of landlord while in reality he is not landlord give reality  his position  compel him to become the landlord or to give  his position. if he take the place of an extortioner and as an idle drone consumes the surplus produce the wealth and capl of the community extuish him  put an end by law to his   in fact create a valuable middle class prohibit absolutely all sublett and thus compel the middleman either to purchase the fee or become as in England a work farmer of the lands which he holds find capl and intelligence and skill to employ and direct labor on his lands. what would be thought in Suffolk for instance  any man who should go there and take a dozen farms as  O'Connell does in cherry and sublet them to small tenants at three times the rent which he himf paid he do noth but receive the rents 1 it would not be borne  but if borne it would soon make Suffolk what the farms of  O'Connell are rowan abode of wretchedness and neglect. it is true that the governmen cannot well compel the negligent among the upper class to attend to the duties of ther position by direct means  but they may by indirect means. whatever tends to raise the tone the expectations of society will compel the negligent among the upper class to meet those expectations. such utter neglect of all the duties of a landlord such contrivances to insure rent and such unscrupulous means as are resorted to to realize it as are sometimes met with in Ireland society would not bear in England. for instance it is common in almost all parts of Ireland to let lands in partnership. in the north and west this is called rundle or  common and the tenants occupy in common and of course the best tell ant will take care not to do more than the worst as he would only be work for the benefit of others and not for himf. if he drain and make a piece of land rich for himf one year another of the rundle tenants gets it in rotation the next year and reaps the benefit of his labor. this would not be endured in England but it arose from a landlords contrivance to make a whole batch of tenants jointly liable for each individuals rent. in Tipperary the same system is extensively pursued under the name of  partnership  holds. there the tenants do not hold in common but divide ther holds. half a dozen tenants will take a tract of land and become jointly and severally liable for the whole of the rent and divide the land among themves. if one tenant does not pay his portion the remedy resorted to is not to distrain his stock for fear of rescue but to proceed by ejectmen  but in order to eject him declarations in ejectmen must be served on all the tenants who are joined in partnership with him. it is true that. they usually club up the money somehow or other but is it possible to imagine any managemen more likely to create disorder than this y in England society would not suffer it would compel in fact the landlord thus negligent of his duty to alter such a managemen of his estate. negligent landlords must improve must attend to ther duties if the expectations of society are raised. but the mass whorish landlords donor afford opportunities for employmen and instruction because they are so em embarrassed that they cannot. they have merely nominal estates the real owners of ther lands are mortgagees. no on can doubt the advantages which the upper assessable to confer on society. society wants an upper class. but it must have it in reality in substance not merely in name. nor does it matter who the individuals are who compose the upper class so long as they are men of education of honor and of wealth. what matters it to society whether the lord of 50000 acorns be lineally descended from the treacherous scoundrel Dermot  or from a respectable cheese and bacon factor of cork or yarn spinner of Belfast who realized a fortune by his industry half a century ago. it is the man society wants  and in that man the power of do good the wealth to give opportunities of industry the knowledge to direct those opportunities the honor to act justly and to set an example to all. but if you have a mere nominal landlord a man over head and ears in debt and embarrassmens you lack in him the first and most needful quality the power of do good. take measures then to give to society that which it wants to stimulate it and direct  real and not a nominal owner of the lands. facilte the transfer of lands. enable an encumbered proprietor to  1 a part of his estate to pay off his encumbrances giv the purchaser a clear title by act of parliamen provided the purchase money be paid over to the encumbrancer accord to priority of claim. it is foreign to my object now to go into detail  but let in the lifeblood and energy and enterprise of caplists into the lifeless masses of huge encumbered unimproved helpless estates. they will become real owners of the land will give employmen upon h and stimulate industry. employmen will br peace. industry will br wealth.   when an estate gets into such a hopeless condition that it can no longer pay the interest of its mortgage debts and keep the owner no longer permit a receiver in chancery to be appointed to receive the rents and hand them over to the mortgagee. the mortgagee has no responsibility and no honor from the estate  he cares noth about it so long as his principal is secure and he gets his interest paid. the nominal owner has no power to do anyth and however well inclined the estate goes to ruin under his eyes. we may respect his attachmen to his ancestral acres and his dislike to part with them  but we must not let his individual likes and dislikes stand in the way of the public good. if he cannot  the duties of his position it is his  fortune  the state must take   the community and the country do not suffer because of it. when this is the unhappy condition of an estate at once compel a sale  let in caplists and substitute a real for a nominal owner of the land. that which his good feel his inclination or his good sense prompts the real owner will have the power to carry into effect.  there are however many landlords who have both the inclination and the power to benefit ther tenantry to give them opportunities of employmen and to instruct them but who ow to the disgraceful system of intimidation that is allowed to prevail are driven out of the country. it is foolish to hope for improvemen if you do not enforce the law if you do not give the consciousness of security for life and property to every man. the outrages and shoots of Tipperary and some adjacent counties are disgraceful to the nation they mark the existence among the people of the most cowardly and savage brutality. it is folly to apply to such a society the humane and moderate provisions of la adapted only for a peaceful and orderly and independent community. no man is independent in Tipperary. he dare not act justly for fear of his life. however much he may hate the crime he must shield the murderer for fear of his own life. he dare give no evidence calculated to lead to the punishmen of an offender for fear of his life. he dare not turn away a servant that robs him for fear of his life. he dare not compel the fulfillmen of a contract or enforce the paymen of a debt. for fear of his life. nay he dare not express a political opinion adverse to the prevail mob opinion forebear his life. for the lord lieutenant to talk of putt in force the ia. in such a state of society as this of summon juries who will not convict and subpoena witnesses who will not give evidence is childish. a free and liberal governmen mild and humane la which depend as much upon the cooperation and aid of the people as upon the law or the governmen are only fitted for an enlightened and orderly and just community  they are helpless and chievous in a cowardly a savage a brutalized and an ignorant one. such a people will bear and require a more despotic rule. fine the community for every crime and enforce the fine. if crime still goes on send another thousand policemen into the county and make the county bear the whole expense. billet the police in the farmhouses and let them worm out crime in a manner fitted to the cautious and timid character of the people. the man who dare  go to the police office and give information  murderer wilint it to the policeman billeted in his house because he will not be suspected of giv the information. appoint stipendiary magistrates for every district and it would be wise to extend ther powers where juries will not convict. if a criminal is sentenced to transportation pack him off at once  do not give him time in goal to leave behind him among his friends a legacy of revenge. punish every brutal crime with a fitt penalty. what cares the man who can gloat over revenge perpetrated or determined on for a three months imprisonmen 1  him at a carts tail through the chief town of his neighborhood him up to the scorn and derision of his neighbors for hav been a cowardly brute with just courage enough to skulk behind a hedge and try to shoot an unconscious victim or knock him seness with a stone from behind. at the termination of his imprisonmen give him a repetition of the same dose and send him home to his friends to doctor his back for him. a few such exmaples as these would have a thousand times greater effect than all the rewards and proclamations in the world. strive overwhelm force to make the punishmen of crime certain and make its punishmen terrible.. if an outcry  raised against you by vagabonds and the press o the  vindicator  class never mind it  uphold what is good in the community and the clamor of the worthless will not injure you.  with a firm and determined hand put down agtion whether that agtion be orange or repeal. if necessary fear not to do it despotically. remember you are deal with a people who in the mass are almost uncivilized. like children they require govern with the hand of power. they require authority and will bear it. a more enlightened community would not require it and would not bear it. rigorously put down all combinations and punish the combinatorial it is a remarkable fact that there is scarcely a trade which has prospered in Ireland save that of brewers and distillers almost every other trade has been ruined by combinations. one  with a few unskilled laborersare sufficient for a brewery or distillery and thane can therefore be no combinations. o skilled workmen against them. for instance and i name these only as exmaples amid hundreds timber merchant of Dublin  James lagan erected sawmills. the sawyers combined against him and because he persevered murdered his head sawyer halon in open day in one of the most populous streets in Dublin.  lagan however had sufficient capl to enable him to persevere and now moor  pit  men are employed in his sawmills because he has created a trade than he employed sawyers before. the same gentle. man leased a uess dock intend to make it a grav dock for the repair of vess instead of send them to Glasgow or Liverpool to be repaired. his men combined and refused to work except on certain terms and at certain times. his he would not submit to and he procured Scotchmen as ship carpenters. about four months ago while some of these men were work at a ships side on a stage suspended by ropes some of the combinatorial got on board cut the ropes and precipted the men into 16 feet of water. ther lives were with difficulty saved. a Dublin magisterial solon before whom the fello who attempted to murder these men were brought satisfied himf and the law by simply bind them over to keep the peace. a  old a printer about four years ago rented a magnificent print establishmen in Dublin and erected steam presses to enable him to compete with the London printers. no sooner had he got contracts and was beginn to succeed than his men combined against him and began to dictate terms to him and the rules en which he should conduct his business. determined not to submit to this he procured english and scotch. printers. almost immediately afterwards his print establishmen was set fire t and burnt down and the grand jury found that it had been done maliciously. this gentleman undertak calculated to give employmen and benefit to the community was ruined in consequence. it is only two monoliths ago that the colliers of  coal mine Tipperary and also of earl shill colliery and south ballistics colliery in the same county worked by the min company of Ireland combined to prevent the agents work them in the merrythought most advantageous and shot one of the agents. the average laborers wages in that district is  to  a day while every colliery was earn from  to  a day. the company have been com spelled to suspend the work of these mines in consequence and a large number of men are thus thrown out of employmen. i have before me a report politely furnished to me by  strongman of Waterford in which that gentleman details the establishmen of a coast fish  company there. there were but few fishermen earn a precarious subsistence there and it was said that the fish had deserted the coast  the trade was declin. four years ago a fish company was established there and a tawler of about 40 tons burden was purchased. i cannot do better than qe his own report of the difficulties every undertak in Ireland has to encounter first from the most stupid opposition and eventually from illegal combinations    first as our mode of fish was novel in this quarter we had to employ Englishmen until some of the natives were instructed  an outcry immediately arose for br strangers when so many at home wanted employmen. then when we told of the profits likely to arise from this mode of fish some accused us of boast while others circulated a report that fish was merely the nominal object but that. smuggl was the real one. one class found fault with us for send any fish to England until ther wants at home were supplied. others. complained of the high prices charged. another set denounced us for tak the bread from poor menor that we caught so much we should not leave any for others  and further that the market would be so glutted and the prices depreciated that even if they did catch as much as they had previously they would not be remunerated for ther labor this latter was asserted by many who ought to have known better  and such be the case it was no wonder that those poor men who fancied ther rights and mode of liv would be infred upon were so excited as to threaten us if we persisted. these threats of course had no effect upon us further than to explain how ill founded those reports all were  but it was of no use and one night a party of them seized a new net worth about  cut it in pieces and threw it over the cliffs into the sea. we offered a reward of  and governmen  for the discovery of the perpetrators but it was no avail  for though one of the men in our employmen knew the parties yet he stated he would prefer be turned off to giv us information fear the consequences to himf. these were very discourag circumstances  but this extreme violence brought matters more speedily to a conclusion. an inspector from the fishery board came down and also a stipendiary magistrate. a meet was held and an investigation entered into. the roman catholic clergy also exhorted ther flocks and after some time peace was restored. since that time other parties have procured similar boats and there are now 12 cutters of 40 to 50 tons burden each belong to this port regularly engaged in this branch of fish besides sometimes as many as 20 more from other places who occasionally visit us. the good wages the men earn has quite altered the current of public opinion and those who were before hostile to us are now anxious we should get more boats and thus give more employmen the apprehension of the fish be all caught has proved fallacious  and so far from this market be glutted h is found the demand has increased with the supply fish hav become an article of regular diet. the cost of one of these cutters with her gear c. is 0  and the value of the gross produce of the fish taken by each of our boats is about  per annul if then we suppose the other boats have been equally successful the 12 boats at  would clear 00 worth of good nutritious food drawn from the ocean by this means giv so much wealth to the community  and there is abundant open for three times as many boats in this branch alone. the men receive certain proportions of what the fish ls for the earns of our skippers or captains average about  per week the men from  to 2. and boys  to  per week  and after pay for wear and tear the owners divide about 20 per cent. per annul with this pleas result i feel no hestion in stat it as my opinion that the sea is a rich mine which only requires to be judiciously worked to yield abundant reward for labor and caplin other words riches. besides the taw ifish our company were anxious to introduce improvemens in other modes  and we began with lobsters crabs and prawns. we procured a suble boat and apparatus cost about  and two qualified hands. the summer before last this boat caught upwards of  worth the men earn  per week while employed and the owners divid 50 per cent. the last summer however we have met with sad appointmens our previous sue cess excited much envy and several of our pots were destroyed. we offered a large reward but without effect. at first the parties cut the apparatus  but latterly they adopted an enious mole by which they conceive they can ease ther consciences as well as escape punishmen. the lobster pots are put in deep water about a mile or two from the shore with a  on the surface to indictee ther position. the plan resorted to is to get a piece of cord about a yard long with a stone tied to each end this is dropped accidentally on purpose edgewise on the float which be unequal to sustain the weight is sunk to the bottom and consequently defies all attempts at recovery. in consequence of these repeated losses i fear we shall be obliged to give up this branch although we offered to the parties we have reason to believe were the perpetrators to procure similar apparatus for them at cost price and instruct them in the proper mode of us it last summer we found the sea to be absolutely alive with herrs mackerel and pilchards from one half mile  miles seaward from the coast but there be no sufficient or suble boats or nets to take them ow to the opposition and prejudices of the people the advantage was entiredly lost with the exception of a very small quantity that came in close to the shore..  it is melancholy to contemplate a stupidly ignorant opposition to enterprises like these from a people starv for want of employmen. the governmen then as a first duty ought to protect every enterprise by the most strent and determined enforce men of the law and secure to tho  the fair rewards of ther enterprise and with it employmen for the people. the people themves ae too apt to take cunn for wisdom  and the cun which delights in the cleverness of ruin a rival or forc terms and rules on a speculator which his business will not bear has not the wisdom to see that in ruin a rival it ruins a trade by which it lives and that its forced terms have stopped the speculation which was its only livelihood. insure by law paymen to a tenant for those improvemens which have increased tho value of the landlords land accord to a fair estimate of the increased value this fa simply honest and fair. the landlord loses noth for he has the increased value for his money and the tenant will thereby be encouraged to improve.  these are indirect means of insur employmen and prosperity. but there are other direct means which are in the power of the governmen.  provide suitable piers and harbors for the accommodation and safety of the fish craft. this would be a direct encouragemen to industry and would leave laziness in sight of an abundance of fish without an excuse on the coast of errs in mayo of parts of Connemara of Donegal of cherry and of the west of cork the sea swarms with fish which often cannot be taken because there are no harbors of refuge. if a Donegal or errs man ventures to sea he does it at his peril if the weather is at all doubtful because there is no harbor to which he can run. and yet these people periodically starve with swarms of fish beside them  and are fed by the money of England which would already have twice over built all the piers and harbors they wanted and have enabled them independently to earn ther own food. with the revenues of the crown lands lease or purchase and promote the drain and cultivation of waste lands. these would act as public ex maples to caplists who might become purchasers for it is from them that general improvemen must come. the governmen can only set exmaples it cannot cultivate the whole country. this would cost noth but would on the contrary pay well.  establish in different districts model farms and agricultural schools to teach and instruct the peasantry by both precept and example how to cultivate the land and make the most of those advantages they have.  attend to reasonable applications for assistance made by enterpris portions of the community. this would encourage and urge them on. limerick for ill stance complains that she has no dock that her trad vess are in danger of be driven against the bridge and in fact. have been thus destroyed  that the navigation of the lower Shannon to the sea which is now dangerous and full of shallo might be improved at small expense while the liberal grant of  by the parliamen of great brin is be jobbed away in improv the upper Shannon and not one farth is spent on the lower Shannon. the citizens of Belfast complain that with a. trade that yields a customs revenue of  a year the governmen will not aid them to build a customhouse for the convenient transaction of business and the collection of the queens taxes. they complain also that ther representations about ther insufficient postiche establishmen ate totally disregarded and that the enormous commercial undertaks of that city are put to continual losses and inconveniences in consequence attention to matters like these is one of the routinedutiesofgovernmen and effects much good. inattention to them excites discontent and depresses and heats down enterprise.  now every one of these measures is practicable. every one of them would tend to benefit to encourage to stimulate the people  to excite emulation enterprise and industry. yet every one of them is neglected such measures would let caplists into the country. the efforts of the governmen at improvemen and civilization would urge on those caplists to imte the example stet to them and they would have the power to do it. the peasantry would be encouraged to be industrious and would be taught how to be so. compare any of these measures in probable benefit with the recent college grants. these grants are thanklessly received by the people. the colleges will teach young men lateen and Greek and theology who had better be learn some honest trade by which to earn a liv. educated young men without means will lie thrown upon the world to fill professions and to become priests  and these young men penniless and disappointed with cultivated minds must become the seeds of future agtion. you complain of the turbulence of Ireland. the means of employmen will stop turbulence. the measures which i have humbly suggested will promote nay insureemploymen.  necessity and poverty said the great lord bale in his plan for a reform of the english poor la  and want of due provision for the employmen of indigent persons and the custom of a loose and idle life daily supply with advantage the number of those who are taken off by the sentence of the law  and doubtless as the multitude of poor and necessitous and uneducated persons increases the multitude of malefactors will increase notwithstand the exmaples of severity. the want says he  of a due provision for education and relief of the poor in a way of industry is that which fills the goals with malefactors and fills the kdom with idle and urofble persons that consume the stock of the kdom without improv it and that will daily increase even to a desolation in time and this euro in the first conception is never remediable but by gibbets and whipps  for there must be a sound prudent and resolved method for an industrious education of the poor and that will give better remedy against those corruptions than the after gain of penalties can. what lord hale wrote of England in his time is true of  now. give then that  industrious education of the poor and those means of employmen which the measures pointed out will insure and Irelandunhappy neglected agted Irelandwill no longer prove  the great difficulty  of the english governmen,REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR IRISH
