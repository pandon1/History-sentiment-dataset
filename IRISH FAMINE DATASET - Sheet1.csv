"IRISH . DISTRESS IN 1846, (FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1846.) {FROM THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENT.) DUBLIN, Auo. 5. The Freeman's Journal of this day con­tains ""he foliowing letter, addressed to the Prime Minister by ""John "" (only) "" Archbishop of Tuam "" :­ "" TO LORD JOHN RUSSELL. _ "" St. Jarlath's, Tuam, Feast of St. Peter ad Vincula, 1846. "" My Lord,-'-Among the many and obvious .grievances that press upon the people of Ireland, requiring prompt and vigorous measmes for their redress, there is one which cannot brook delay, involv­ing as it does the lives of thousands of the inhabitants. I have read with sl).r­prise, and with somewhat of dismay, the report of a speech attributed to the Chan­cellor of the. Exchequer, announcing the fearful intelligence that the relief which, through the means of employment on public works, had been in some instances tardily meted out to the people, was, 'from the 15th of August, to be withdrawn. That auspicious day has, since the intro­duction of Christianity into this country, b~en a festival, bringing joy and gladness to the people. Suffer it not, then, to be dreaded as a monument of national mourning. You might as well at once issue an edict of general starvation as st.op the Ritpplies which the feeble creatures are striving to earn with the sweat of their brows. The scenes of jealousy and discontent that are of daily occurrence on account of the real or fancied preference which some claimants for employment receive, are evidence of the pressure of hungei:-; ' and never did a mutinous crew pant more eago:\rly for the partition of a rich booty, than the s_tarving inhabitants of Ireland do at present for the miserable pitt:rnce earned on the publicroads. ""-Allow me, then, in the name of a faithfnl and suffering people, to implore of you not only to stretch the present re­lief on an 0i1farged scale into the middle of the mo'nth of September, but not to suffer the great council of the nation to rise without adopting prospective 'mi;asures . for the similar but severer calamity of the coming year. Some Member c,f Parlhmimt is said to have re­marked, dtirihg the discussion to which I allude, that a people was not to be fami­liarized to the practice of depending on Government for their sustenance, aad that aid, during an extraordinary season was not to be conve1 ted into the rule of ordinary ye21rs. Nothing could be more just than tllis principle ; nor is it over­looked by those who now appeal to the Legislature for the extending of its pro­tection,', Visitations such as that we are passing through are n0t always confined to one season. Nay, they sometimes con­tinue for two or three successive years. That the disease in the potato is of that character is now, alas ! too evident, from the melancholy concurrence of the reports attesting a , more fearful failure in the crop than that of the last harvest. But these are not vague reports.. Having recently passed through extensive tracts of country and made a minute examina­tion into the state of the potato, I can bear testimony not orily to ~he premature withering of the st~lks, and consequent decay of the roots, but hnder stalks of which the leaves were still green and sound the roots were diminutive in size and in a state of rapid decomposition. The fact is then so, and to throw a people accustomed for some time to meal diet on potatoes that are, some rotten, arid almost all unripo, would be to aggravate all the evils of famine with the horrors of pestilence. . "" It is not, then, on the miserable and peddling scale of levelling hills on a ma:il coach road that th~ physical wants of :a niimerous people are to be relieved, but by those extensive and necessary im­provements which, while they mitigate distress, will afford to the Government an adequate remuneration-such as the erec tion of eiuays and piers.along the western and southern coasts, by which the exist­ing miseTy would be, relieved,ancl courage given to the hardy natives along those coasts to explore and cultivate the rich and ahundant fisheries on which any: be11evolent statesman' could draw fo'r supplying the wants of the people.' Those ,are public works which the people have a right to expect in retiirn 'for the ample l evenues with which their industry: et1! riches the Exchequer, . '!l'hey 'know they are improvements which an Irish Legisla­ture would not delay. You may perceive, then, how the natural calamities of the country are furnishing arguments in favour of justice, and as if rebuking the reluctant tardiness of statesmen to con­sult for the prosperity of Ireland. The pittance doled out this year for their re­lief would form but a small item in the millions abstracted without _any return by absentees, whom an Irish Legislature would have kept at home to fulfil the duties as well as to enjoy the benefits of property. Are you, then, surprised that while a nation is brought to the verge of starvation,they are panting for the peace­ful accomplishment of a measure which, even in years of ECarcity,. would supply _them with abundance, and in years of plenty would enable them to devote their-surplus revenue to the cultivation of the arts, the encouragement of science, an~ the foundation ~of benevolent insti­tut10ns? "" The trying ordeal out of which the people are now passing with such natience, notwithstanding the severe pri­vations which they still endure, has had _the effect of imprinting more deeply on .their souls the necessity . of a domestic legislature. Fear not, however, that they meditate for that purpose either violence or insurrection. No,the weapons of their warfare are peaceful, constitu­. tional,, and persevering remonstrance. They are resolved to make known the hideous injustice with which they are still treated, an.d determined to proclaim that the peace or discontent of an entire nation are interests too grave and too sacred to be tooked on as mere political signs fo measure the degree of the eleva­tion or de-dine of the Whig or Tory factions. With the advocates of physical force and sanguinary revolution we dis­own all sympathy. The impure sources from which they have imported their dogmas of infidelity and disaffection we abhor. It may be well worth the while of a profound statesman to pause, and consider. whether, for the sake of vitiat­ing the Catholic religion and weakening the influence of its priesthood, it is not hazardous to erect infidel colleges for the propagation of an infidel and revolu­tionary mania, which, should it succeed in overturning. the altar, will not spare the throne in its career of demolition. Far wis3r is it to provide for the starving and faithful people, than establish such mischievous institutions1 the hotbeds of every moral and political vice, and waste the public revenues on the sinecure salaries of professional idlers. Conse­quences must be traced to their prin­ciples. The turbid stream is easily known from its il:indred and congenial source. The peaceful advocates of repeal are not' making experiments of violence or war. They argue on the justice and necessity (which even this year illustrates) of a people protected from hunger and starva­tion by the care of a native and paternal Legislature. This is a just principle, and they rely on its progressing in despite of every effort to crush it. All connexion with the mischievous men who are for forcing into the country th,::i educational despotism of France and Prussia, the dangerous dogmas which they strive to spread, they entirely repudiate. Their confidence is in the patriarchal patriot of half a century, who, with the peaceful principles of the Catholic Church to guide him, has already advanced Ireland to a pitch to which no military success could have raised her during the same tbw. In the same peaceful course, and under his leadership, the people of Ireland are determined steadily to push on their claims, until the monster ev~l-the frightful anomaly of the Protestant Church establishment-is annihilated by the tardy justice of the Legislature, and until no obsta;cle remains to prevent the _cordial union of all clasrns in bringing about a peaceful achievement of the re­peal of the union. This consummation may be delayed by the followers of Maz­zini and Voltaire, but cam,ot be pre­vented. It well became those who were clamorous for infidel colleges, to be next the consistent advocates of force and in­surrection. The most profuse and dexterous application of Whig patronage cannot divert the people of Ireland from Repeal-the necessary goal of all previous reforms ; nor could the most inflamma­tory effusions of the ]Jarodists of ' Young Italy' ever drive them into rebellion. Repeal they cherish ; their country they love ; but there is another affection which winds closer round their heart than either -that of their religion. Between country and religion, hitherto united in their love, a divorca is now insidiously at­tempted by the enemies of both. They will find themselves bitterly disappointed; for though the Irish people, free from bigotry, and anxious for justice, will practise the social virtues towards all, without distinction-nay, will not refuse the alliance of those who, on perfectly fair and peaceful grounds. will advocate the public good-they will stiU jealously which, through all its vicissitudes and wa~ch the movements, and sternly sever disasters, have form8d the chief glory of the partnership of all who would attempt, Ireland.-! have the honour to be, your guise, however specious, to very faithful servant, debauch those principles of attachment to "" JoHN1 ARCHBISHOP OF TUAM,"" the Catholic religion",IRISH .

"(LEADING ARTICLE, MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1846.) under any the Throne and. to The rev1vrng cry of Irish distress, to statement, the cause of so much actual dis-which 'the PREMIER is to-day to call the tress-it is now too evident is returning attention of the House, comes in at a for at e:ist a second time, under more melancholy juncture to remind us that a dismal circumstances, and in a grave:i; session has passed away, and little indeed form.

Several measures, fear of starvation, left unusually little it is true, have been passed-nay, their surplus, the loss appears t:o be far more number has been made the subject of complete.

It is a.ware that much has been done for that at least safer to believe them, and there'­country. It is not that many are prepared fore, on a principle which aJ;iplies as well to dispute the probable efficiency of the to our social a~ to our religious obliga. half-dozen Irish acts of this session. The tions, it is also more right. But we have simple fact of the case is, that very few now before us the history of the recent indeed know that any acts have been distress,-if, indeed, there has been any, passed at all. Fearful, as we are, that it break,-and the methods taken to alleviate will be impossible to do much for that it. The fate of those methods will warn miserable peasantry without laying greater us how little they can dispense with the burden& on Irish property, and exacting absence of a permanent remedial systei:q~ from it better securities for the general They c'.lnnot even be called an apology well-doing than any British Minister has for relief. So mixed are they in their yet dared to propose, of course we augur tendency, so avkward, so wasteful, so ill from the absence of serious and noisy intrusive, that, necessary as they are, we opposition. We miss that ready instinct, can only class them with necessary evils: that desperate terror,with which property We believe that every precaution has is wont to defend itself from costly obh-been taken to secure as wise, as just, as gation, and are led to infer that for the economic an application of the .publi~ present it _deem~ that the bitterness of benevolence as the circumstances allowed~ ""confiscatwn-"" 1s p-ctssed. Yet it is too evident, first, that a very And now that melancholy cry is raised large absolute expenditure, amounting to again, and in the urgency of the imme-£357,000, besides a much larger,sum in diate distress, ws have no other alterna-the way of advance, has left thiflgS no _tive l_mt to look on Ireland as if al~ yet better than they .were ; and then-, .that remained to be done. Tho much-derided inconveniences of a_ positively and c,alamity of last season, which events have gratuitously injurious character haf~ proved to have been so exaggerated, and resulted. - ,;_ yet so real-the subject of so much over-'fhere has been an absolute waste, Ii; . is nobody's fault, but such is the fact. Taking the whole commercial view of the transaction, the cost of the Indian corn and oatmeal has been considerably-above the market price. The question of its being sold or given away, or sold at what is popularly called "" the cost price,"" has nothing to do with this view. vVe are speaking of the total cost to the ration. The 98,810 quarters of Indian corn and oatmeal have c03t, including all the out­goings that could be included in the esti­mate-such as freight, grinding, and other expenses-as much as £185,432. But this, of course, has not been all the ex­penses. Itis added, significantly,"" The pay of the commissariat officers, of the Ord­,nance and militar:iofficers employed under the Board of Works, and the expenses 'of the Admiralty steamers for the con­~eyance of the meal, are provided for in the estimates of their respective de­partments, and are not included in this :statement."" Now this, of course, is in itself a very trifling affair. When the question is a famine, this country can afford to throw away hundreds of thou­sands. But it is as well to observe that the British Government unavoidably makes a bad merchant. That is not its !)alling. Even taking into account what is given to the charity account in this transaction-looking only to the cost of the food-it is a losing and wasteful affair; and the private speculator who did no better would soon be bankrupt. We repeat, it is no one's fault. No power, no sagacity, no care on earth,could under­take at once an entirely new mercantile transaction, out of its sphere, with new persons, and in new places, without con­s.iderable loss. The whole experiment wa~ out of the regular streams of traffic. !rhoroughly approving the step, as we do, we yet may point it out as a warning that Government cannot continue it, or fall into that style of policy. It is not its office to supply food, and it cannot do so-without waste. There -have been other effects more serious and virtually more wasteful than this direct. and demonstrable waste. The prices both of food and of labour have been injur!ously, though_ inevitably, in­terfered with. That tenc!ency to produ ce in excess, to accumulate, and to reserve, which is the very first and most nece 0sary instinct of trade, without which there could be no wealth, no power, no nros­perity, no peace, no improvement,-no society at all, has been discouraged. Dealers have been disappointedanddriven from the market, perhaps not always to retnrn. Their useful craft has been baffied, their lawful store depreciated. So much have they felt this "" heavy blow and great discouragement,"" that at this moment we hear they are besieging the Irish Secretary with questions whether the relief measures of the past season are to be renewed next winter. Should such be the intention, they will take a common senss view of the fact, and not invest their money in food. The natural and spontaneous purveyors for the people are thus disabled and destroyed. 'l'he usual storehouses, on which the chief reliance must be laid, will be thus found empty. A gigantic interloper, in the shape of the public benevolence, has ruined th.e market. He does it only once or twice ; but "" once or twice "" is serious in com­merce. The demand of the dealer in food encourages the producer. Both rise and fall together. Labour, too, has been both injuriously enhanced and diverted. The alternative, or mere hope, of pottering a half-day on the road, or some such "" improvement, , hu,s withdrawn hlbour from the fiel<ls of the few Irish agriculturists worthy of tbat name, from the railroads in progress, and to a very remarkable extent from this island. It is said that this year, when the demand for labour has been far beyond all precedent, there have been fewer Irishmen offering themselves for harvest or railway work tl:an were e,-er known. The story among the Irish immi­grants themselves is that their friends are staying at home in the hope of employ­ment in their own ,neighbourh@od from the recent and forthcoming grants. vVhether their emplovment on suz:h works as are likely to be seiected by kcal relief committees is likely to be so profitable as the employment from which they are rnduced, we leave our readers to decide. Are these results suflicient reasons against such measures of instant relief as were adopted in the winter 1 Certainly not. Necessity knows neither law nor pru­dence. If we are dying of hunger, we must kill the milch cow for the sake of its flesh. vVe must, and there is an encl of the question. But it is as well to re­member that small measures of immediate and extraordinary relief are dearly J?Ur­chased,","(LEADING ARTICLE, MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1846.)",2,8/17/1846
"THE PUBLIC WORKS BILL. (DEBATE IN PARLIMIE-:ST, TUESDAY, Al'GUST 18, 1846). 'rhe House of Commons wet;tt into com­mittrn on the Public Works (Ireland) Bill. In the committee, Lord J. RcssELL referred to what had been done in the course of fast year, and in the spring of this year, by the fate Government, on the failure of the potato crop in Ireland. Having shown that in the purchase of Indian corn, in donations, in aid of sub­script.ions, in public works, in general presentments, and in various smaller items, the Government had expended for the relief of the people of Ireland £852,481, of which £494,851 was dther repaid or to be repaicl,he proceeded to ex­amine indetail the amountof the evilwhich this money was expended to remedy, and to describe to the House the benefit which was derived from that expenditure. He expi:essed his sorrow at being obliged to state,that although there were,at present, in the greater pnt of the counties of Ire­hmd, harve~t work and wages sufficient for the support of the labouripg popula­tion, the prospect of the potato crop was this year even more distressinis than it was during the last. Having corroborated this 6tatement by private letters from Lord SHANNON, Lord-ENNISKILLEN, Lord BERNARD, Colonel Jrnrns S1nTH,and other individuals in various districts of Ireland, he proceeded to explain to the House the measures which he intended to propose for its adoption, in order to make provision for some employment for the labouring people of Ireland. He proposed to intro­duce a Bill to this effect-that the LoRD­LIEt:TEN.ANT should have power,on recom­mendation made to him, to summon a barony sessions or a county sess10ns for works for relief of the poor ; when those sessions should have assembled, they .would be empowered an'.i required to order such public works as might be necessary for the employment and relief of the people. The choice of the works would be left to them, and they would be put into execution by theofficers of the .Board of Works. Advances would be made from the Treasury for the purpeses of those works, to be repaid in 10 years at 3¼ per cent. interest, the lowest ra,te ever taken for works of this kind. Having described the manner in which he in­ tended to provide for the repayment of these advances, he next informed the committee how he intended to provide for the case of poor districts, where it would be impossible for the money to be repaid. He proposed to grant £50,000 for the pur­poses of those districts, where works of public utility would be undertaken by the Government on its responsibility. He also propcsed that commissariat officers should be stationed in different parts of Ireland, who should from time to time communicate with Sir R. RouTH on the state of distress in the several districts. As evil had arisen from interference by the Government with the supply of public food, ho did not propose to interfere with the regular mode by which Indian corn and other kinds of grain might be bronght into the country. There might, however, be particulnr cases where it might be neces,ary to employ the commissariat officers. He also added, that all the officers of the commissariat, and of the Board of Works, would be paid by Go vernment for the services they performed. Having these objects in view, he proposed first, that a sum should be voted to defray the expsnses already incurred ; then a vote for direct advances by Exchequer Bills for the purposes stated in the Bill, apd then the vote for the districts which might speedily require it. He considered the present as. a special case requiring the interVfmtion of Parliament, and rendering it imperative on the Government to take extraordinary measures for the relief of the people, He trusted that the course which he was proposing would convince the poorest among the Irish people that the House wasnot insensible to the claims which they had upon it as the Parliament of the United Kingdom. He concluded by assuring the committee that the late Ministry had shown a very laudable anxiety to meet this evil,-that the remedies which they applied had been suited to the occasionA-that the present Government was imitating the spirit in which they had acted, and was endeavour:. ing to take advantage of their experience to correct errors which were inevitable, in consequence of µnforeseen difficulties.,",THE PUBLIC WORKS BILL,4,8/18/1846
"A POOR LAW NECESSARY FOR IRELAND. (LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19, 1846.) It is no great praise to the Minister to say that his measures for the relief of Irish distress are a decided improvement on those of his predecessor. So much is due to the interval, brief asit is, between the respective dates of .the two sets of measures. The few months that have elapsed have removed that political in­credulity which refused to admit the seriousness of the disaster, and boasted itself insensible to sufferings of which the sons of wealth were never likely to have any personal experience, These few months have also given too probable an earnest of a long, or at least an in­definite, period of straitness and priva­tion. More than all, they have exhibited the working of temporary measures. A practical nation like ours will not go on long temporizing with evils. Measures of coercion, indeed, we have been glad to make temporary enough. No terms could be too short for enactments that pre­sented so flagrant a violation to our own notions of constitutional usage and law. But the British Legislature will not go on for years feeding and employing the poor of Ireland on a mere extempore system, for the simple reason that food and employment are not, like flogging, fines, and imprisonment, merely occa­sional necessities. Every month is now adding tot-he argument for some better plan for employing and maintaining the Irish poor ; amd common sense points out that this plan must be permanent, as also . that it should not be simply_ an annual grant from the public Exchequer. Really, then, we do not see how Lord JoHN RussELL could escape the conctusion to which he has ::iome. The district is to employ and feed its own poor. That simple formula fulfils tbethree conditions of the question-I. The poor must be employed and fed. 2. That is a uniform necessity. 3. The publio Exchequer can­not undertake the cost, nor the Govern­ment the sole administration, of relief. No prejudice, no ingenuity can avoid the only solution of this p110blem. Accept the premisses, and you have implicitly 'consented to a regular system of out-door employment and relief. We can imagine statesmen willing to go to any extremity rather than acknowledge this oonse­quence-willin.s: to go on a.nnually suh­sidizing the poor of freland-equally wil~ing, perhaps, to_ see them annually decimated by famme and pestilence­rather than adopt a provision which happens to be part of the wisdom of our ancestors. But unless a Minister be pledged up to his neck against the old p-ractice of British benevolence, we may now safely appeal to his candour. The occasion has come, Ireland must have an effectual system of Poor Laws. As the necessity is urgent, as well as for other reasons, Government, in the first instance, advances the money. "" While there ought to be public works, an d tho3e public works ought to be undertaken under due 'control, the cost of these works will not be defrayed by means of grants, but by loans, to be defrayed by the baronies and the counties in t.he districts for which they were 'granted,"" In those last words consist the virtue and vitality of the measure. The district in which are the persons employed, and for the benefit of which the work is to be done, will itself defray the expense. The machinery is the next question. The proposed Bill will give power to the LORD-LIEUTENANT, on due recommendation, to summon a barony sessions or a county sessions, for works for relief of the poor. ""When these sessions shall have Jieen assembled,"" the PREMIER proceeds to explain, '' they will be empo~ered and required to order such public works as shall be necessary for the employment of the people and for their relief ""-"" I say empowered and required,"" continues the PREMIER, because it is intended that it shall be incumbent on them, on being summoned, to order those works.'' Here is distinctly recognfaed the local duty of finding em­ployment for the poor. Under existing circumstances, the locality most suitable for the apportionment of this duty is the barony of the countr, itself. '!'hat is a matter of great indifference. "" Public works,"" of course, are great roads, canals, drains, enclosures, navigations, and such undertakings of general' and extensive utility. For them, of course, a large district ought to be assessed. The choice of the works will be a matter of arrangement between Government and the loca.1 sessions. The latter will be invited to suggest and recommend, and Government--that is, the Board of Works-will approve. As the public advances the money,and the improvement effected by its outlay will be the chief security for its repayment, it will be proper to provide against an imprndentand unremnnerative expenditure. It is neces­sary also to protect the interest of the ratepayer in a country where jobbing is rather a custom than a sin. The Board of Works is already in possession of the ground. It has an immense stock of local information, and projects on its shelves enough to remodel the Emerald Isle to almGst any conceivable fashion. The difficulty is to select and to execute-a difficulty which will not be met by sur­rendering everything to a local scramble. The Board of Works has also the requisite st1ff. To its officers, therefore, the execution of the public works will be com­mitted. For our own part, so little are we tied to any prejudice in favour of purely agricultural employment, that we do not see why these sessions should not negotiate the employment of the poor on railroads in progress. The ,fact of their legislative sanction presumes their utility ; and it is also very evidently the policy and the duty of the Government not to aggravate the serious difficulties of those gitantic undertakings by holding out to la~our any strong counter attraction., It is proposed that the money be advanced at 3-1, per cent. interest-much less than what Irish railroad companies, and any other Irish borrowers whatever, are now in the habit of paying. The loans are to be repaid in 10 years ; and the levies for that purpose are not to be according to the assessment for the county-rate, but according to the assessment for the poor's rate. A proportion of the expense, there­fore, will fall upon the owners, and the poorer occupiers will be in a great measure relieved. These provisions, we think, will be found to meet the superficial, not to say flippant, objections we have re­cently heard made to an efficient Irish Poor Law-viz., that it would swallow up the whole profits of the land, and that there is not capital enough for the pur­pose. '.l'he capital will be provided ; and if the works are selected with tolerable judgment, and executed with moderate economy, we cannot doubt that the capital will be reproduced, and will re­main on the land after it has been re­funded to the Exchequer. But, it is ridiculous to say there is no capital where there are labour and land. Tha there is capital in Ireland sufficient for a liberal Poor Law is evident from its ex­porting a greater quantity of food than any other equal country in the world, That at least is an undeniable proof of its actual wealth. A conntry which exports the meane of supporting millions can, of course, 11ay for its own improvement. In principle, it must be observed, this measnre is no innovation in Ireland. That country has all along had a system for the employment of labour. It existed, however, in a peculiarly [rish form, as if meant to be abused. The grand juries feared neither GoD nor man ; they were amenable neither to Government nor the ratepayer ; so they jobbed away labour and money with the same utter indiffer~ enGe to justice and public utility as the agrarian lawgivers living around them showed in jobbing away human life. There will be ample security-all the security that the empire can bestow-against such mal verRation in carrying out the forth­coming measure. The Board of ,vorka, will be responsible to the Imperial Par­liament for the wisdom of its sanctioruI, as also for its economical execution of tl!_e public works ; and the Legislature will then be to blame if the Board of Works is not kept tp its duty.",A POOR LAW NECESSARY FOR IRELAND,2,8/19/1846
"ENGLISH PROPERTY TAXED FOR IRISH DISTRESS. (LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1846,) A week or two after the beginning of done was no more than the bounden duty the session w~ brought OJ? ourselves so.mo o! the strong to th~ weaJr, that Ireland by very grave rebukes by simply recordrng virtue of the Umon might demand this the fact, that Ireland's weakness had assistance, and in according it the Im­become England's opportunity, and that perial Legislature only admitted a the opportunity had been duly improved peremptory plea. We should not recur by certain spontaneous acts of generosity to the subject, nor run the least risk to that suffering isle. It was answered of offending our sensitive neighbours, with great solemnitv, that what ha.d been but for two fBL'.ta. First. the popular instructors of Ireland maintain the extra­ordinary doctrine that it is the duty of the State to feed the Trish population. Secomlly,this demand is really addressed, not to a few rich proprietors, but to a population who, as to outward opportu­nities, are much on a par with the Irish themselves,-viz., the labouring clasrns of England. The claim which we have heard lately enforced \\ith all the passion and acerbity of spiritual indignation is, that the British labourer shall maintain the Irish, whenever the latter finds himself situated as the English labourer generally is--viz., without provision for the future. We are not conscious of misrepresenta­tion. The labouring classes of this island pay the bulk of the taxes, and therefore are the chief paymasters of the empire. It is maintained that whenever the Irish peasantry are short_ of potatoes they shall be found in employment andfood,at their own doors, from the public fund-that is, at the expense of the British labourer, who, it is unnecessary to say, can claim no such indulgence on his own account. For these reasolls, we collsider it lleces­sary to record what the Legislature is doing for Ireland. By virtue of an Act which last night received the Royal assent; the Exchequer is immediately about to lend molley for the execution of public works in Ireland. That money is to be adYanced within the ensuing twelvemonth, and repaid in the course of the llext ten years. Meallwhile, it is to pay the moderate interest of 3½ per cellt, Now, take this measure at the best, merely as a regular loall. Suppose the money to be well employed, alld pullctually repaid. Suppose that the execution of the works brings no extra­o/dillary cost on the State. As a mere loan, it is llO inconsiderable favour t0-the Irish at the cost of the British labourer. The latter is to pay into th~ Exchequer, say olle million more, this year, from his deep poverty alld illcessant toil, in order that this sum may be buried, produc­tively we hope, in Irish soil. H is so much deducteil from British and added to Irish capital. True,,the former is to be, gradually reimbursed. But, what is reimbursemellt in ten years, alld interest at three-and-a-half per cent., to all in­ ,dustrious nation like the British ? There il! a phrase, for which a distinguished mall incurred more ridicule than he deserved, about remittillg taxes that the money might "" fructify "" in the pockets of the ,people. To adopt this expression, the million is to fructify ill Ireland instead of ill Ellgland. Every labouring man on this side of the Ohallllel, when he is con­triving his next year's Michaelmas rent, may consider that he has five shillings less, on account of this Irish loan. Let no one venture to cavil at the statement that it is the labouring man who lends the money. To enable the Sbte to advallce this million, be it more or less, we must go on one year longer with an equivalent burden on some necessarv of life, and consequently also on the trade, manufacture, and commerce of the country. That strikes home to every working man. If the working men of this island are content to contribute a million by way of loan to their suffering Irish brethren, we can only say it is ex­ceedingly kind of them. May they never miss it themselves ! But that is exactly what we are saying, aud wbat we wish to impress on the gentleman who subscribes himself, ""JoHN, Archbishop of TuA.:.r."" We are anxious to stamp on the tablets of his mind the llotable fact, that for the next ye:ir we shall be paying a poll-tax amounting to a shilling ti-head for every man, woman,.and child, to make up, say a million, for the immediate relief of our poor Irish countrymen. Let him not supposA that this is a trifle to a British labourer. If he wants to know out of what poverty this kindness is afforded, let him read the account of the Dor2etshire peasantry which appeared in the same copy of our journal as his own epistle. Five shillings ~s a great deal to a family fed, clothed, and housed on 7s. a-week. It is our deep affection and admiration for the patience, peacefulness, alld in­dustrv of the British labourer under the most adverse and trying circumstances that prompts us to these reflections. I;Ie is the veriest dr11dge of drudges, it is his delight to be called a servant, he can call nothing his own he possesses,-he claims no land, he knows no rights, ho accumu­lates no store,, he forms llo conspiracies, he frequontsno demonstratiolls, hegathof's round no leader. Yet thesa patient crea­tures are in fact subscribing for' the employment of a class, which claims a much higher position in tho social sc.1le. Tha,t is the "" rent "" which they gather. But we are anticipated with a rorly. Let that reply be hea.rd. Ireland, H urges, sends millions to England ; why sh~ll not a portion of this wealth return to the soil ? If it be so, that does not -affect the honourable part of the British working classes in this ,transaction. Th0y .do not receive the rents of Ireland. By all means let Irish produce return to the land, by taxing .Irish property for the employment of the poor, But when British industry submits to be taxed for this purpose, we can only say that it is exc3edingly generous, and deserves more thanks than it is likely to obtain. We must, however, protest against the system of working the "" willing horse."" It will nev.er do for the Irish poor to depend on British industry for employment. Is that so extravagant an apprehension that there is no prospect of it ever being ful­filled ? On the contrary, things tend very much this way. It is becoming an every­day occurrence to charge British industry with the duties of Irish property. The Imperial Exchequer has ju_st virtually made a grant of no less a sum than £5,000,000:,-out and out, to the Irish landowner. We are indebted to Lord MONTEAGLE for his forcible way of putting the sacrifice. Irish property, up to this day, has condescended to pay somewhat more than a third of the expenses of the Irishconstabulary force; a sort of expense which it is unneC!iJssary to say English counties and English towns pay for them­selves, withput troupling tlieir neighbours for a farthing. That"" third amounted to £160,000 a-year, equivalent to a capital of £5,000,000. -We now discharge the Irish landowner of that obligation. We present him with the money. Hence­forth, while the English and Scotch wholly maintain their own county and municipal .police, the enormous and ex­pensive police force of Ireland is wholly saddled on the Imperial Exchequer. This is one instance of a tendency to burden British industry with Irish obligations. Other instances will be fresh to the memory and familiar to the knowledge of the reader. This year we have already advanced more than £800,000, of which­£350,000 is not-to be repaid. Nor will it be forgotten that Irela.nd pays no assessed taxes, no land-tax, no income-tax, and is favoured even in the Excise. There is a manifest tendency in these things. It is a growing evil. The moment Lord DEVON'S monster report made its appearance, we immediately said that its animns was the relief of the landlord ; and that if anything would come of its recommendations, it would be the very me-a.sure we have just alluded to--the throwing on the State the remaining third of the police. The landowner, with infallible aim and relentless grasp, h_as secured his interest in Lord DEVON'S suggestions. So we go on. The peasant is starving, and we subsidize the land­owner. Rents rise, and the peasant starves more than ever. We Bhall be told, perhaps, just now it is rather un­gracious to be making these exceptions, But unless we do things ""just now,""-,l. unkss we point out the true nature and bearing of enactments just when they are passing, we should despair of procuring. attention to the subject. We think that British benevolence has been considerably imposed upon, not so much .by the Irish peasant, whose distress is genuineenough, but by the Irish landowner. He makes the same use of his peasantry as the gipsy does of her stolen child. She pinches the poor creature, and extorts our alnis on the strength of its sufferings. One could almost imagine that some .crafty beldam of .a landowner was pinching JOHN, Archbishop of TUAM, when he howls so much to the landowners' tune.",ENGLISH PROPERTY TAXED FOR IRISH DISTRESS,2,8/27/1846
"EFFECTS OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POTATO CROP. (LETTER TO THE EDITOR, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1846.) Sir,-1.rhe prospect of a second year's famine in Ireland is far too serious an event to be-regarded as a passing emer­gency, or to be met by a temporary expedient. We may vote millions to alleviate thil impending calamity-'-we may cover the nakedness of the land with cargoes of Indian corn ; . but when all this is done we are as far from the end of our labours as. ever. The vote of this. year.does not diminish the chances .of. a famine the . next-ra.ther, it increases them, And, what is worse, people seem to acquiesce in this state of things, .as if there were no help for it-as if Natm:e had fixed her irreversible decree that once at least in every four or five years Ireland snould be laid waste by famine. To judg.e from the almost periodical recurrence of these visitations, and from the j;one in which people speak of tllem, one wo~ld imagine that Ireland was some barren rock or thirsty wilderness: in an inhos­pitable region of the globe, to :which Nature had denied all the gilnial qualities of soil and climate, and which 11he had filled with an exuberance of population, without affording them the means, or even the possibility of subsistence. One would imagine that this miserable people had neither hands to labour with, tools to till the earth with, nor grain to sow it with. Such is really the aspect in which we of this country seem to re­gard the inhabitants of the sister island during the period of one of their usual famines. Our sentiments towards them are simply th03e of pity. Oh ! how shocking, we exclaim, that those poor Irish should have lost their potatoes again ! Where shall we find something to feed them with ? We do not think of inquiring whether or no the dependence of a whole nation upon so precarious an article of food be a necessary or an un­necessary evil, and if unnecessary, whether it oµght not to be in every way denounced a.nd discouraged. We do not think of inquiring, with Bishop Berkeley,"" Whose fault is it if poor Ireland still continues poor 1"" /Now, the best friend to the Irish. ~ould be he who could effectually per­suade them that the fault lay entirely with themselv€s. They inhabit a country a great part cif which is at least equal in fertility to our own, with more that is capable, of being made so. There is no reason, except their own wilful mis­management, why they should not grow as. fine crops of wheat as are raised in the Lothians, and, after feeding themi,elves, export the surplus to our shores.-Yet, after years of present suffering and fear­fi:µ. expectation, they idly and stupidly persist in staking their very existence upon, "" a crop the precarious nature of which is no more than a fair set0 off against the small amount of labour re­9uired to produce it. Without entering into tho question how far the laws and custQms relating to landed property in Ireland, how-far the landlords tbemselvE's1 are responsible for this evil, I may safely assert that the prejudices and ignorance orthe Irish people are at least as invete­rate and as fatal as their misgovernment a,nd the ill example of their superiors have been culpable and injurious. Every Irishman must needs be a farmer, aud work as much or as little a:s he pleases ; the idea of being a labourer,and engaging in regular employment, is revolting t-0 him; The great object of his life is to rent a miserable patch of land, to build himself a hovel, or burrow in the rnrth, to marry, and, if possible, to live as well as his pig. The word "" improvement "" is not in his vocabulary ; he is coJ;Jtent to live as his forefathers have done. With such exalted views in his mind, the first question is, how to realize them ; and to this the potato furnishes a speedy though treacherous reply. No otherarticle of food promises so much at so small a cost. An acre of potatoes will maintain four times as many people as an acre of wheat, while the time and labour of cul­tivating it are comparatively trifling. Here, then, are abundant means of grati­fying his love of idleness and what he calls independence. And -so long as Nature bestows the years of plenty trom her revolving cycle, and withholds the years of famine, things go on smoothly. For a month or two ourfarmer. is busied with phinting his potatoes ; for another month or two he leaves. his home and comes to reap where hr sowed not, in the smiling harv_ests of England ; while for tho remaining two-thirds of the year ho does nothing but sleep, drink, or beg. But Nature will not isuffer her laws to be broken with impuuity. She l1as made daily labour the condition of daily food ; and those .who will not submit to her decrees must be content to pay. the penalty. Thus, famine is .the certain re­compense of a cheap and idle subsistence; and while the latter, in addition to its other evils, tends to multiply population to an unhealthy extent; and to perpetuate their miseries, the former stands ready, with scourge in hand,to expel the noxious brood, or to lash them into' indµstry and prudence. Nothing is more certain than this-that the dense population of Ireland and. its squalid condition are pri~cipally owing to the potato. "" Had it not been,"" says Mr. M'Cullcch,"" for the almost univenal dependence of the Irish people on the potatcdor the principal part of their sub­sistence, coupled with the facility with which they_\lbtain huts ana slips of land, it is quite impossible that population could have advanced so rapidly as it h!is done dl).ring the last fifty years,"" The same writer ubserves,-""So-long as pota­toes are used only asa subsidiaryspecies of food, their introduction serves to imprqve the condition of the labourer, and they frequently 11,fford him an additional means of support in years when there is a failure of_ the corn crops,"" But those who are habitually and entirely fed-on potatoes are placed upon the extreme verge of human subsistence. -. When deprived of their accustomed food, they are unable, from the smallness of their wages, to purchase what is dearer ; and there is potato famine in Ireland were to continue nothing cheaper to which they can resort. five years longer, it would prove a greater To a people placed under such unfortunate blessing to the country than any that has circumatances, scarcity and famine must ever been devised by Parliamentary com­be synonymous.""

"THE GOVERNMENT SCHEME FOR RELIE~ (L,;ADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1846.) The accounts we continue daily to re­ceive from all parts of Ireland leave no room to doubt the failure of the potato crop. From the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear, from Limerick to Dublin, not a green field is to be seen. The disease having attacked the plant at a much earlier period this year than it did in 1845, the root has been arrested in its growth and prevented from arriving at maturity. Thus, what was last year but a.partial destruction is now a total anni­hilation; and it has become a very general b~lief that the month of. December will not. find asingle potato in the country. ~eland is, therefore, doomed to suffer a r!ilcurrence (if it should not rather be called a continuance) of thit distress which has well nigh pauperized the whole population. Taught by fatal errors .of policy to look to the State for assistance, Ireland stands now in an attitude of con­fident expectation, waiting for the public supplies which hitherto h11.ve not been denied her. Should they be denied in future, there will be much bitt!,rness and great 09mplaint. It is an inevita.bl_e con­seq,uence,-as inevitable by Governments as mdividuals. Benefits qnce conferred, if they be not ?ontiriued, are SJ?eedily for­gotten, and m place of gratitude, breed but discontent. It is a law, or a vice, of human nature, and we are not to look for an exception among the Irish people. If any abatement is made in the anioµnt of relief afforded_ f.rom the public funds, or ~y change in its application which savours at all of retrenc~ment, the Go­vernment will meet with more abuse than thanks. The people expect to, be fed, and one way or another they. must be fed. The precedent once eatablished'must be followed, and there is an end of argument. If with the experience of the present we could recall the past, and place our­selves again in the autumn of 1845, _there are few, if any, of the measures then adopted on behalf of Ireland which would now be approved. We write in no spirit of hostility to that country ; but, on the contrary, with the most earnest desire to recommend what is most con­ducive to her lasting interest. She has suffored too much already from temporary measures, from the application of super­ficial remedies, which, alleviating only the symptoms, have aggravated her disease. We desire to Jlee an end of this patchwork policy, if policy that may be called which is nothing but a series of makeshifts. .There is a ki,nd of . spend­thrift generosity that benefits neither the giver nor the rec!;)iv_er, and of this_ c.om­plexion have been the ~lms bestowed_ by Great Britain upon her sister island. The State has still some millions of Irishmen to support, who> in spite of all that has been done for them, are rather worse than better for its charity. And why i Because the charity has been bestowed without judgment, and . accepted without gratitude. Neither the character nor the condition of the people has been im proved by the transaction. ­ The measures propcsed by the present Ministry contain several marks of im­provement, and the germ, at least, of a more far-sighted policy.. We pub~isb in another column a miuute of the Lords of the Treasury, intended for the guidance of the various officials in Ireland, which shows that the details of their 1 elief system have not been adopted without mature eonsideraticn. One principal error of its predecessors the RussELL Cabinet is determined to avoid. The State will not meddle a second time ,with the provision-market, nor plindly ent~r into a competition with private trade, at once suicidal of itself and destructive of its rivals. Indeed, with the experience of the past and present year still fresh in the recollection, it would have been little short of madness to repeat the experi­ment of feeding the Irish people from Government stores. The change, how- UNIVERSITY ever, is not with@ut exception. In some districts, too poor to command a market, and t'.Jo difficult of access to repay the merchant,-for instance, on the coast of Oonnemara, or the most wret,ched parts of Clare and Kcrry,-food will still be sup­plied from Government stores, not to underbid the private ~rader,but to supply his place. The exception does not seem injudicious ; for, as the only obj6ction to the former plan was that it interfered with the ordimtry market, where there is no market to interfere with the objection fails. .Another great improvement is in the urn of Government works, which will be more sparingly applied and with greater discrimination. Employment on relief works also is to be afforded to those only wlio cannot obtain it elsewhere, and to them 2,t lower than the average rate of wages. The necessity of this restriction will be understood by those who have real the correspondence between the Go­v.ernment and its commissioners. Major SurMONDS, in a letter dated the 4th of August, writes thus from Limerick :~ "" Nothing can be finer than the corn crops now being cut, but ~lowly, I am told, for. want of labourers, resulting, it is to be feared, from the injudicious con­tinuance of public works, as well as in the mismanagement of some committees, in not gradually withdrawing relief from persons able to work."" It is notorious also that fewer -lrish labourers have offered themselves for the English har­vest this summer than in 'any previous year. These facts are but too significant, and their purport has been duly appre­ciated. There is still, however, in the new measures some of the old leaven left. The changes, although in the right direc­tion, are still chiefly of detail ; the prin­_ciple is preserved which governed the late Administration. That principle we find it impossible to approve. We cannot, by any process of reasoning; be ~onvinced that the general b::idy of the nation ought to be taxed for the support of particular districts in Ireland. The theory and practice of the Constitution are alike averse from such a proceeding. Nor do we feel ourselves in the slightest degree nearer conviction, when we reflect upon the consequences which flow from the ap­ plication of the principle. We ask, in the first place, who are the persons chiefly benefited by it? Ara they the peasantry, the poor, the mass of the population 1 By no means ; for to these it is indifferent whence the money comes, so long as it is not taken from themselves. For whose sake, then, is it? It can be for none other than the landlords. These suffering gen­ tlemen, sinking under burdens which never until now were heard of, groaning under a pressure of taxation which never until now was felt, ask, and unhappily for their country obtain, a relief in com­ p:irison of which the subsidies afforded to the peasant are but dust in the balance. Perhaps it wiil be said on behalf of the Government that we have misrepresented its intentions, which are not to throw the burden of Irish poverty upon the national funds. It is true in theorv that the sums to be immediately spent iii Ireland are to be returned at a remote period, and by numerous instalments, the wm:iks con-­ structed by their aid being the security ­ for repayment. This is true, we_ say, in ­ the_ory-that is,it is true so long as practice ­ does not make it false ; but we appeal to any impartial person in the least ac­quainted with Irish affairs, whether there is the slightest probability of the money being in fact repaid. For ourselves, looking at the state of the country and . the inveterate habit of jobbing which prevails among all classes, we are forced' to the conclusion that the so-called loans will in the end prove gifts. We, there­ fore, call them by their true names. On the whole, however, it must be coll~ fessed that HER MAJESTY'S Ministers have made the best of the Irish difficulty. Like the steward in the parable, Lord JoHN RussELL has done wisely, at least for_ himself and his ow,'l credit. His measures, there is every reason to believe, will in­ sure a sufficient supply of food during the coming winter. Thus Ireland, paid by the State, and, where needful, fed from her stores, cannot for very shame, continue to assert-that' "" England's danger is Ireland's opportunity.""",THE GOVERNMENT SCHEME FOR RELIE~,2,9/2/1846

Those who know anything of Jh& co1mtry will read it with regret­thou who do. not, with surprise. . The_~ is nothing exaggerated, nbthing et,.ted to awaken sympaihy, and nothing !let down lo mislead. The whole is the ,ft81llt of personal observation, and of in­formation from unquestionable so-µrces, '.l'he barony of West Carbery, in the -eounty of Cork, contains a population of aheut 87,940, according to the census of ]Ml. . One-fourth of that number will not be der.era so far as want of food from th1:1 failure of the potato crop. This one-fourth comprisefl the whole of the.resident gentry, the tradesmen and Mtisans employed, and the bette11 classes of th& farming popt1lation,especially aucb BB have leases of their fnrms. -The:i;e remain three-fourths, or about Go,958, who are actually deprived of their iOtllf means of subsistence, and of paying ,their house and. potato-ground rent, by -the failure of their pQtato crops. Take from these three-fourths one­ ,tenfib, who will be almost constantly em­ ployed in agricultural labour, in fishing, and lyJhe resident country gentlemen, and tlu,re remain 111bout 59,359 to be fed for 12 months (supposing no other potato on public works or by Government aid, combined with a liberal and prompt con­tribution from the landed proprietors, and all other wealthy and independent individuals resident. in,or connected with the barony of West Carbery. Take this large portion of the popula­tion of the barony (who.must get food) at the miserable allow.ance for each of..three­halfpence per day for 12 months, which makes only £2 5s. 7½d. per head per annum, and it will give a total sum OJ £136,298. Now, the value of the potato crop of this number, at the very moderate calcu­lation of two acres for each family (the average number of each family being taken at only five), and at a valuation of but £8 per a.ere, supposing the crop to be sound and to have come to maturity, will give the sum of £190,240, which, large though it be, would not be equal to sup­porting this number for 12 months ifthey had not the usual employment, occasion­ally at least. What, then, must be the condition of this very large portion of the poor population with their entire crop of potatces lost and without any employ­ment? But ,suppose a well-distributed system of public works to be decided on and actually commenced (which is not the case yet), and let it be equal to affJrding constant employment for 12 mouths to the number requiring it, it will be found by making only a reasonable ceduction failure), either by constant -employment for Sunc'ays, holidays, and wet days,. &c., from the 29th of September, that the men will not have more than three days out of seven for six months to earn a scanty subsistence at 8d. a day if they are paid so much, and this must place the unfor­tunate labourer who has a. family (and how many a.re there that havenot1) i11 the most miserable position that imagination can fancy ; iu fact, actual starvation in its fullest sense would be preferable, because it would put a period at once to his sufferings, mentd and bodily. This, Sir, is a pitiable and a degrading picture, but it is a true one. Under this view of the subject, it is evident that no system of public works alone, however liberally and extensively entered upon, can produce the required amount of relief, or prevent famine, with its desolating accompaniment, disease, from scattering destruction over the whole barony ; and there is, alas ! liut too much r~son t?. fear, nay, to. be certain, that this portion of J:reland will hot suffer more severely than many others.

"ANTI-RENT ,MOVEMENT IN .TIPPERARY. (MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1846.) . (FROM. THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENT,) DUBLIN, SEPT. 4, A letter from the county of Tipperary ..,f yesterday's date, published in the Mail of this, evening,indicates that an anti-rent war has commenced in that district, the ultimate object of which, the writer seems to think, is the overthrow of the landlord as the prelude to the establishment of "":fixitJ of tenure."" H~ says,­ "" In diverse parts of this district, si.nce the,Jiarvest has. been cut, some landlords and,a.gents have thought it prudent to make, in certain in~tancef!, a distt'es~ on the crops of defaultmg tenants. Previous to the respective sale days appointed, written notices have been posted in each place of public resort for some miles around the vicinity of the place at. which the sale was advertised to take place, those notices being to inform the public that they are expected to attend to pre­vent a sale taking place. The consequence. has bee17 th!Et within .the last week large multituaes have been assembled at the several places appointed, and have sue cessfully, in these instances, prevented any sale takir.g place. In one instance, which occurred yesterday, preparations were made for the attendance of a large military and police force at the scene of an mtended sale, for the purpose of protecting the party authorized t-0 sell f but their presence was dispensed with'1 owing to that party deeming it useless to prosecute the affair, as no one would ven­ture to bid for the e!focts exposed for sale. The friends of disorder, however; assembled, and I make no doubt that had the sale taken place, blood would 4ave been shed. To exhibit the character of the warfare that has thus begun, I may mention that in the case to whfoh I havo just alluded, the tenant owed but £16; being one year's rent of a nice farm.; and I am credibly informed that the wheat crop alone on it is value for £50. H~re, then, was ample provision for' the rent, with a. large overplus-besides which were an oat and a turnip crop. For such a tenant no sympathy 9n the score of want of food could exist ; and therefore the organized opposition to the payment of rent is fully manifested. That such a state of things must be met by prompt and determined measures on the part of the Government and landed proprietors no one should for a moment gainsay-if not, anarchy and confusion will overcome law and order, not ,,nly will ruin be brought on many individuals, but the entire rights of property ""ill become subverted. Taking into consideration the severe loss of food that has beell\ JiUStained by the p2ople, it will become landlords to exercise the utmost extent of leniency toward3 their tenants who have been suffarers-and who is it that has not been ?-but, of course, in different degrees, proportional to the ~xtent of their other means."" I.n the mi,antime, the landlords, naturally alarmed at the present dis­couraging aspect of affairs, are bestirring themselves, and several influential gentle­:inen have already come forward with pl,ans and suggestions for the considera­tion of the Executive ; the majority of w:hich, although more or less objection­able in the details, tend to show that the public mind is at length thoroughly awakened to the danger, and that a crisis is.appr:mching tbat will consummate the work tardily commenced by the institu­tion of Lord Devon's Land Commission. '.1.'lfere appears in print this evening a letter addressed to Lord Bessborough by Mr. Horace Rochfort, of Clogrennan, a magistrate, and Deputy-Lieutenant of the county of Carlow, in the course of which, referring to the recent landlord meeting, held in Limerick, under the auspices of t.he Earl of Devon, he observes :­ "" Mr. Monsell's proposal ' to compel ~'0 landlord to provide productive em­~loyment for the poor upon his estate,' ip, I believe, in many cases, quite im­practicable. Many landlords have had tp.eir estates handed down to them with a .dense and wretched population, and, moreover, heavily charged with mortgages and other incumbrances. This year eJi;treme difficulty will be f0und in col­~9ting the rents ; and if with diminished 111eans they are still to be more heavily taj!;ed, a.JI their present efforts to employthe poor on productive lal:our will be p11,ralyzerl. Still, God forbid I should assert that, £,Jr this present year,we oughtriot to be provided 1vith some such tem­porary measure as now proposed, to mitigate the impending cahmity ; but, with -reference to future seasons, I do assert that, to pursue, year after year, the same course, would soon eat up all the resources of the country. I entirely agree with Mr. Monsell, that the general employment of the people on productive labour cm only be accomplished by the direct agency of the landlords ; but they can only be enabled to perform this duty by some such plan as is contained in the following sugi;re3tions being adopted by Government in the ensuing session of Parliament :-Let them carry out, to a grea~er extent, the principle already acted upon in the Drainage Act and Board of Public Works Act. Let them lend to all landed proprietors, who possess encum­bered estates, money at 3½ per cent., to pay off their existing mortgages, taking from them a first charge on their property at 5 per cent., and binding them clown to lay out the differnnce of intere3t be­tween 3½ and 5 or 6 per cent. annually on their estates in permctn2nt improvements. These improvements to be carried out by the landlords themselves and their tenants, under the immediate supervision and control of the Board of vVorks, assisted by an additional staff of officers. The fund by which they would be car­ried on would thus be created out of the difference bet1veen a low and a higher rate of interest, and that without risk or loss to either party. The landlord would, probably, have no objection to having thA State for a creditor., instead of an indi­vidual ; and the paying off of so many mortgagas would have the effect of un­locking so much mo1 e capital fcr invest­ment in land, and its improvement. By this plan one of the great objcc tions to absenteeism would l;e done away with. In many cases now a large rental is swept yearly out of the country, and little or no return given. But in every instance where such ab!!2ntee landlord owed. money, and chose to avail himself of this act, a portion, at least, of his rental would be returnEd and invest_d in lasting improv€ments. To this mea­sure no objection of a party nature could be made. All persons circum­stanced as I have deEcribed would, I am sure, gladly avail themsG!ves of it ; and tho~e landlords who now possess their incomes clear, but hitherto have not been inclined to expend mcney in im­proving their estatEs, would, for very shame, be forced onwards in amicllble rivalship with their neighbours. Employ­ment becoming more g2neral, the wage11 of labour would of n£cESsity rise, and the labouring class would be enabled to pro­cure a more substantial dfat, and to with­stand with courage the failure of t}e potato crop. A higher system of agricul­ture would be introduced,based on all the modern discoveries, and aided by scifmce and the spirit of inquiry now abroad ; and I feel sure that the small cottier tenant would not be left behind in the general progress cf society around him, If by better farming he could be enabled to pay his rent punctually (and such memb<Jrs of his family as were not needed on his, allotment would probably find plenty of work as labourers), the great temptation to his eviction would cease, and thus the chiefand primary cause of all agrarian outrage would be checked. When­ever, in the opinion of the overseer of the Board of Works, an estate had been improved to the uttermost, I would suggest that the sum previously expended upon it every year should be applied as a sinking fund to pay off the principal of the charge held by Government ; we might thus look to the next generation coming into possession of their estates not only highly improved, but also freed from those heavy charges which now paralyze the energies and cramp the best intentions of the present prQprietors. Recollect the conclusion to which the shrewd and talented commissioner of 'l'he '.1.'imes arrived :-That it was the want of capital and enterprise, on the part of the landlords, that tend{ld to keep Ireland in her prernnt backward state ; and he recomreended every facility being given t<;> the transfer of property, that it might come into other hands better able to afford an outlay. But how flow this pro­cess. How difficult the sale of a deeply­mortgaged property is found to be. Adopt the principle of the plan I now propose, and you attain, by a different means, the same beneficial results. Neither the Sta~e nor any other public board, with all their exert1011s, can meet with effect the present crisis. Their work is, of necessity, almost unprofitable, and their expendi­ture is la.rge ; and each succeeding year, if persevered in, it will fall with re­doubled weight upon the land, till its burdens beoome intolerable. Instead of this,stimulate and encourage the energies of the resident gentry of Ircoland-tell them you expect them to perform their duty, and to come to the aid of the millions, now without food,or likely soon to be so ; and hold out the promise that you, the State, will take away every excuse for backwardness, for that you will supply the means ; and I firmly believe that every corner of our island will ere long present the aspect of thou­sands employed on productive labour, and that each year will draw closer the bond of union between the upper and lower clasrns, and render the latter less de pendent upon the potato as their sole supply of food."" The suggestions here thrown out by Mr. RoJhfort were to a certain extent adopted by Lord Mountcashell, at a special meeting of the Fermoy Board of Poor Law guardiar.s.","ANTI-RENT ,MOVEMENT IN .TIPPERARY",1,9/7/1846

Being more induiitri-Ous and skilful; and therefore richer, than other nations, we are now permitted to buy without stint, in the open market of the world, that food which our wealth puts in our reach, and which our industry and skill most fully deserve. There is a universality in the present disaster which immensely simplifies its consideration. The case is just this, that the whole labouring population of these islands, from Kent to Tipperary, from Dorsetshire up to the Highlands and the Western Isles, have lost a great part of their winter stores. It must be remem­bered.that the Eµglish, the Scotch, and the Irish peasant are exactly in the same evil plight. The Irishman is destitute, so is the Scotchman and so is the English­man. In England it is no unusual cir­cumstance for even a prosperous labourer to find himself at the end of the harvest with absolutely nothmg in the world besides the clothes on his back, a good master, and credit at the bhop. It is no unusual thing for a more average class of labourers to find themselves climbing the bleak hillside of winter with nothing, .not 1,ven credit or a master. The nation is not convulsed, Cabinets do not meet daily, Parliaments are not summoned in a hurry, suspended by Ministerial changes, and protracted into autumn, by events of this ordinary character. Ire­land and the Highlands are now in the very same case, and the empire is at its wit's end for a remedy. ,,1nat, then, is the difference 1 Whv is that so terrible in Ireland, which in England does not create perplexity,and hardly moves compassion Y We ask this question, because it appears to us of the very first importance to all classes or Irish society to impress on them that there is nothing really so peculiar, so exceptional, in the condition which they look upon as the pit of utter despair. It is an object to impress on all that they must do as we do here ; they must be gradually assimilated to our state.; they must adopt our methods.; and agitate, if agitate they will, for a perfect community in our laws, as far as those laws appear to be the source of our greater prosperity. The letters and extracts froin the Irish Press which we have lately given to our rcaders show how deeply the delusion of some great legis­lative panacea has taken p()ssession of the Irish mind. 'l'he State ! the State is to do everythinz. Tl1e labourer asks the State for national employment and national food ; the landlord, with equal importunity, demands a national loan. Does the State attempt this in England ? But can the State anywhere make either employment, or food, or money 1 It cannot. It is true it may make the attempt, but it is certain to fail. It can only succeed in exercising a slight regu­lating power of these things when it is so fortunate as to find them ready to its hands. The landlords ask for a loan. They put their demand in this specious and moderate form :-"" We are burdened with mortgages,"" say they, ""at 5 or even 6 per cent. Lend us money at 3½ per cent., and pass a law that what is gained on the change of lenders shall be spent in the employment of the people and im­provement of the land."" Alas, for the perverse ingenuity, for the hardihood of promise, and confidence of expectation for which needy men in all ages have been so remarkable ! How can the nation lend this money ? 'Jhe eum required would be no trifle. The rental of Ireland is estimated, it appears, at thirteen millions. Suppose it mortgaged to not quite half its amount, and then you have an aggregate debt of one hundred millions, paying an interest of five millions. Where is the State to get these hundred millions 1 Or half, or a quarter ? To exchange only a quarter of the Irish mortgages for Government loans would not be thought much relief, but that would cost twenty­five millions. '.l'he State is itself the greatest debt<?r in the world.. ~t alread_y owes nearly 01ght hundred milhons ; so 1t is only one debtor asking another, who is unfortunately still deeper in the mire, to help him out of his difficulties. We question whether the State could borrow even as much as five millions for this purpose without injurious conse­quences very near akin to those experi­enced by the owner of the goose that laid golden eggs, as soon as he attempted to "" realize "" the useful bird. Jt would, in effect, be a creation of stock to that amount, and would throw down fhe market price of all securities, and raise the rate of interest t:> an extent which, in the present feverish state of things, it is by 110 means agreeable to c~intemplate. It is not impossible that ~overnmeµt might find that borrowing five millions at 3~ per cent. was, after all, no such easy affair. \Vhat becomes, then, of the un­fortunate money-lenders themselves 7 The Irish landlord may possibly think it a waste of sympathy to care for that usurious race. He would not shed many tears if mortgages and mortgagees were m!l.de to take their several parts in one splendid mito-da1e, But he must remem­ber that there are times when the sight of a c ,pitalist is not quite so unpleasing ; and, with a view to contingencies, it is desirable not entirely to extirpate the race. So gigantic a competitor as the State, offering money at 3~, would not leave many of the breed on Irish soil. There is no chance whatever of the scheme being attempted, so it may per­haps seem unnecessary to sift it. We are merely offering reasons to a class which is apt to fabricate a grievance out of a simple negative, however just and necessary it may happen to be. The State, once for all, c&tmot len:d the m_oney. _~t cannot borrow the money without 111 consequences. It cannot undertake the invidious, t.he impossible, selection of objects for its bounty.

"THE FOOD CRISIS-SUGGESTIONS FOR RE:LIEF. (FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1846.) (FROM THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENT.} . DUBLIN, SEPT. 9. The present crisis and the measures taken by Government to meet the emer­gency have called forth the following memorial from a very influential meeting of the bnded proprietary of the county of Meath,-held under the auspices of the l'tlarquis of Headfort :­, , To his Excellency, John William, Earl of Beesborough, Lord-Lieutenant Gene­ ral and General Governor of Ireland. "" We, the Central llelief Committee of the baronies of Upper and Lower Kells and Fore, having already, in our several local committees, reported to your Excellenoy our operations arising from the failure of last year's potato crop, are now desirous of submitting our unanimous opinion respecting the nature of the measures re­quired to meet a yet more extensive calamity. We have, in the first place, to expresR our conviction that the case which we are now called on to meet differs, not only in degree, but also hr the nature of the evil, from that which we had to contemplate last season. Last year, when it appeared that a considerable portion of the food of the people had. perished, we confidently anticipated that at the return of harvest the people would be restored to the enjoyment of their usual supply. We had, therefore, to provide for a present, but temporary, deficiency ; and our exer­tiona for the relief of the people were adapted to such an emergency. We did not then at all contemplate a remedy by producing out of the ground a aubslitute for that which had perished ; the tempo­rary necesaity would have passed away before such a remedy c.ould have come into operation. All that was possible in that present distress was to accomplish a fair and economical distribution of the food _which remained, scpplying the actual deficiency by the purchase of foreign corn. To effect this, it was only required that the labouring population who had lost their food should be furnished with more than ordinary resources in wag81J. The readiest and the most available means of affording such wageu was found in the making and levelling of roads, and other works of the like description ; and such works were therefore generally adopted. These works we conceive to have been suited to the emergency, and highly useful for their temporary p,:m­pose. But we feel called on to express our conviction that the present deficiency is not temporary but permanent. None. of us now entertain the expectationthat next year's potato crop will put an end to <>ut difficulties by supplying food for the people. We have no longer a temporary deficiency to meet ; and we cannot re~ on those expedients which were hastiIJi. adopted to meet a pressing, and, as it was'i hoped, a passing emergency. We ara satisfied that a continued reliance on thos; expedients, so far from 11ffording per;,, manent relief, must inevitably aggrava~e the evils, with which we are now threaten~d, and preve 4ighly injurious to the true mterests of all cla~ses. For the question is, not now of the distribu­tion, but of the prodnction of food. We have not now to relieve a temporary distress, but to make provision for the food of a people. We cannot hope for t.be permanent supply of the deficiency of our home produce from the introduction of foreign corn, to be paid for by a tax on the land, which has ceased to be produc­tive. ,ve cannot now look on any remedy as adequate or safe, which does not s,im at producing out of the ground a supply Qf food equal in quantity, and, if possible, superior in quality, to that which the ~ound has heretofore produced. We are of opinion that such a remedy is to be found only in the employment of addi­tional capital and hbour on the land. It is to the united exertions of the land­owner, the farmer, and the labourer that we must look for a substitute for the food which has perished. To stimulate their energies, and to direct the application of the capital, the skill, and the Jabour of these several classes to the increased Qultivation of the land, afford the onlymeans of escaping from the evils with which we are threatened. Any measures which tend to divert to.other objects the C/ipital and labour which ought to be so employed, must, to a corresponding ex­tent, withdraw it from that channel in which alone it can be really useful. To anticipate the available resources of the country, and to compel or induce tJie outlay of them on public works not P.roductive of food, or of any commodity which could be exchanged for food, must fearfully aggravate the dangers of our posi­tion. Such, we are persuaded, must be the ul_timate result, if the relief of distress l:gJhe ensuing year is to be effected by a cpntinuance of the system of public works. Under that system, two classes, who ,have heavily suffered in their incomes,­tbe"" landowner and the occupier,-aretaxedfor the relief of the national distress, ':which results from their peculiar misfor­tune. Their already lessened funds are .taken away from them at a time when t,lie increased application of capital to the gi:ound is most essential to the national ,~ety ; and those funds are employed in withdrawing the strength of the labourer from the production of food, to expend it in a forced and unnatural extent upon works which, when completed, would leave him in a state of starvation as before. But this system of relief tends further to discourage and paralyze the exertions of landowner mid farmer still more than it disables them. If the man who is willing to employ additional labour on his own land is also to be taxed for the suppc,rt of those labourers whom his neighbour will not employ, he will be overburdened, and will be driven to relieve himself. This he cannot do but by restricting his voluntary expenditure, and throwing his labourers as well as his neighbours upon the common fund, as the only means of equalizing their burdens. Many who have employed additional labour already feel that they will be constrained to adopt this course, in self-de-fence, if last year's system of relief be persisted in. On these grounds, while we are pre­pared cheerfully to undertake whate11er burdens .are necessary for the relief of present distress, and to make every exer­tion which may be required to provide for the future support of the people ; and while we are willing and resoh'ed, at all hazards, to provide, by public works, the promptest relief for immediate a.pd urgent necessity, we feel it our duty to deprecate the continuance of a system which tends to discourage the exertions of _landlord and farmer, and to miaapply the labour of the people. And we earnestly recommend, as the principle of future relief, the adop­tion of the maxim ' That the labour for which the land is compelled to pay should be applied in developing the productive powers of the land.' Private justice and public policy alike call for its adoption, for the preservation of the people, under the heavy calamity which it ha.s pleased God to bring upon us. Believing that in free discussion will be found the best means of applying a principle so essential to the national welfare, we shall direct the attention of our baronies to the sub­ject, and we respectfully rrnommend it to your Excellency's consideration.""",THE FOOD CRISIS-SUGGESTIONS FOR RE:LIEF,1,9/11/1846

It is enough to state. Lend the landowners £10,000,000. Where is the money to come from 1 In a few months will it not be found possible to procure money except on the most usurious terms for the many vast under­takings this island is pledged to-let alone Ireland 1 It is impossible to cal­culate what depression in the muney­market, what pressure on banks and private resources, what inextricable diffi­culty, nay, what instant ruin to respect­able mert'..antile firms, what collapse of credit, what closing of manufactories, what cas~ing out of workpeople miiht be the result, in the present staie of com­mercial affairs, of the issue of Exchequer bills, or the creation of a new stock to so serious an itmonnt. But who are the parties on whom this demand is made 1 It is assumed, with sufficient 1\-uth, that England will be the principal lender. Ia the English land­owner to advance money for the main tenance and employment of the Irish poor, whom their<>wn landowners refuse to maintain and_employ? He maintains and employs his own, if not as humanely and.nobly as one could desire, at least twenty-fold better than the Irish Iaad­owner. Is the English labourer to com­pensate the Irish peasant for the loss of potatoes, and secure him a regular em­ployer for this next twelvemonth 7 Why, the English labourer is in just the same case. The Englirh labourer has lost his potatoe.,. Throughout extensive districts of this island he will not recover the seed he has sown. Already villages are sicken­ing with the attempt to use the tainted wreck of the crop. Already cholera and typhus are the fearful . companions of want. Not one English lab-ourer in ten has at this moment either a stock of food, . or means to purchase food, for a month. He depends entirely on employ­. ment ; and many, full many, must this winter leave their homes, and traverse the country in quest of work. But are the English manufacturers-millowners or operativAs-to feed and employ the Irish 1 They will soon be hard driven themselves. The direst, and we think the justest apprehension of scarcity, per­vades the manufacturing districts. What does Lord GEORGE BENTINCK say 1 ''l:Inless tlie crop of 1846 is one-third greater than the,crop of 18i5, which all know it is not, it is clear that before next h'.irvest there must be a great scarcity of grain. "" These words are ruin to manufacture. They announce the closing of a thousand factories. How are the.chief sufferers by this '' great scarcity"" to feed the Irish millions wben they cannot get bread for themselves 1 Is it just that they should be the victims of so absurd and cruel an experiment 1 ­ It is a very favourable way of puUing the caRe of a loan to the Irish hnctowners, to call it equivalent to the grant of a given quantity of actual fo:id. Call it 3,000,000 quarters of wheat, or 5,000,000 qu[trters of Indian corn. The Impi'rial Govern­ment enters the market as a purchaser to that extent. Who does not see how greatly this muet enhance the general orice of food 1 How mstny poor people, how many labourers, artisrns, tradei, and employments must suffer-nay, how many continental populations may be involved in the wide-spread aggravation of cala­mity, by so large and sudden an inter­ference 7 And why this int'erfercnce '/ For what particular good is this general evil 1 That the State may make an experiment certain t::> result in the most injurious consequences. Money or corn, whichever i be, adva.nced in these excrn­sive quantities, cannot but be most shamefully s-1uandered.. A Board of Works officered enough to superintend the em­ployment of Ireland, and a commissariat large enough to meet its weekly demands, would be equivalent to an entire recon­stitution of Irish society.

"IRISH LANDLORDS AND THE DISTRESS. (LEADING ARTICLE, FRID.AY, SEPTEMBER 18, 184G.) The position of the potato in the social economy .of Ireland has yet to be a.scer­tained. There prevails a good deal of error on tl1is point. The potato is treated by many as the natural food of that people. Use, of conrse, is second nature. The Irishman, it is said, requires a soft mouthful and a large bellyful of food. Bread is too hard for his mouth, and too compact for that other less dignified organ which plays so important a part in the physical and poli,ical constitution of man. '.]'his view of things apnlies with equal force to the tribes that depend on the pre­carious arrival of fish to their shores, or seals fa their icebergs, or who dispense with the encumbrance of clothes. , Kind Nature perforce ada.pts herself to almost any privation. This is all that can be said of a dependence on patatoes. But we entertain no doubt whatever that the hungriest and most squalid bogtrotter in Connaught, whatever his present con­dition, if it should be considered an object, could with judicious treatment be brought to bear a dinner of turtle soup, roast beef, pheasant, and ice punch ev~ry d'l.y of his life, without bein~ very much the worse for the change. So thoronghly are we the creatures of hJ.bit, and so easily adapted to the most disagree­able change~. The potato, therefore, has no more claim to be-considered the Irishman's nationa.l fo:i<l than that very wholesome and palatable dish which 1s called in this country an ""Irish stew,"" or any other production of which Ireland is proved to be capable. It.is not in the physique of the peasant, but m the moral and commercial system of the landowner that we must look for the natural lmbitat of this root. It is one of the means by which the landlord exacts a rent wholly out of proportion, not indeed to the natural wealth of the soil, but to the capital invested upon it. In a country without capital, and without that security for life and for property which capital requires, the c.-omforts and dec!mcies of life pull against rent. Could the Irish live on the tops of their potatoes, tpey could then give the roots to their landlords. Could they go abroad without clothes, each family would pay, perhaps, ten 'ehilliugs more than it does-such being possibly the aunual outlay in that fashionable luxury. The commercial principle of this view is familiar to every ho:iseholder. No person of ordinary pru­dence will keep a hunter to do the work of a nag, a horse to do the work of an ass, o-r a man to do the work of a boy. A -ro~a.-rd f?r 1!-PI?earances wil! occasionally reqmre a oev:iation from this rule ; for, whatever a certain noble lord ruay: think to the contrary, even a curate's wife will hardly think ""a donkey cart "" a suitable conveyance. Where profit is the question, the general rule is to adapt the means to the end ; and to be as thrifty as the habits of those with whom we have to deal. and our own charity, or delicacy, will allow. It is for a good reason, therefore, that lrish landowners are always so ready to back up the potato. "" Pat thrives upon it,"" they cry ; "" see what work he does on a good dish of murphies ! He would not thank you for bread."" In ordinary times nothing can compare, we are told, with the potato. '' Bring it into England,"" our provincial philan­thropists are exclaiming ; '' give every man his quarter acre of potatoes, and he is independent. No need then of poor laws or labou-r rates,"" Happily, however, Nature, in a larger sense of that much abused term, protests against this de­li.berate degradation of her sons. Every now and then she throws in an item, peculiarly her own, which fearfully dis­turbs the false balance of the base calcu­lation, Blind ignorance and mad dis­content, conspiracy and rebellion, dearth &lld pestilenca, and every other disorder incident to human existence reduced to the very zero of support, prove to the statesman, if not to the landlord, that there must, after all, be an error in the account. The cheapness of savagery failt to compensate for t.be expense of con­trolling its outbreaks. A nation of bar­barians may be cheap to the landowner,' but it is ruinous to the State. A costly soldiery and police must make up for tha inferiority of the domestic standard;' and when the lowest possible average of life sinks occasionally to a level befow the stretch of the most elastic endurance, the nation is called in to supply the terrible gap. That, in fact, is what the landowners of Ireland are now, with an importunity approaching to impudence, demanding of the Imperial Government and Legia- lature. "" The. potato has disappointed, us for once,"" they say ; "" so you must make it up for this year, and help us on to the next."" The only use of .corli is to prop up the potato. Instead of consider­ing that, whatever is done, the wretched. policy of encouragingthis crop has already entailed a serious loss to the nation by enhancing the price of all other food, these gentlemen consider tha.t the State i1self must immediately, aggravate that loss by an immense artificial-drain of food into Ireland, sure as it is, under such peculiar circumstances, to be most wantonly squandered. '' All that Ireland wants is the potato : "" but then, when the potato fails, the whole nation is to ad­vance a loan or a gift, for it is much the same thing, to the amount of three or four million quarters of wheat, in order to make up the failure. This is like doi11g without warm .clothing, but reproaching one's neighbours with inhumanity be­cause, when the winter does at last sefl- in, they will not part with their blankets. and great coats. If we are exaggerating the tone of these aristocratic mendicants, we beg to refer to their wo}1ls. At a great meeting of landlords held, at Oast}ebar la1<t, Saturday, the Earl of LuoAN pre­siding, the Marquis of Suoo proposed and carried, WA have no doubt. very triumphantly, the following :resolution:'- "" That the potato, whfoh constituted. the food of at least nine-tenths of;the popu- lation of this county, amoantiiig to nearly 400,000 persons, is now totally gone ; that the failu,re last year was partial, and, as we had hoped, tem­porary in its conse9.uences ; our posi tion now is beyond comparison more alarming. The calariiitv has now . be­come a national and general . misfor .. tune, and ca'n only be met by nation.al resources."" It was then resolved, with equal una­nimity,-' . "" That it is most urgent that the Government should at once provide, throughout the country, such a supply uf meal as will enable the destUute to pro­core it at moderate prices ; for, without A11llh a provision, itis to be feared that no local exertions can prevent starvation."" The meeting then, w:ith that readiness . muUertility of invention which charac­terizes all Irish distress and Irish. impor­tunity, but is miserably incompetent to provide for. the day of calamity, proceeded to suggest how the national grant could lie IM'bantageously emplc>yed.

"POPULAR .COMMOTION. (SATURDAY, SEFTEMBElt 19, 1846.) (l'B.OM .THE TDrES' CORRESPONDENT.) DUBLIN, SEFT. 17. The accounts from the provinces to-day are.a.aything but satisfactory. Although no very formidable outbreak of the masses bas yet occurred, it is perfectly manifest t'hat unless prompt and decisive measures be ~ken to procure employment, e¥on tempora.ry, the patience of .thepe.ople will be:wom ant, while some proprietors are liiggling .about the exact interpretationof an Act of Parliament, and othors-con­t,nving tho best means of eluding its pro­visions. Much of the present commotion appears to have been created by the very ~per tlirection embodied in the Treasury minute, which fixes t~e wages to be given to, labourers on public works at 2d. peraiem lesa than the average rate of wages paidin the districts where such works are being constructed. The subjoined extracts a.re taken from the country papers of yesterday:-. (From tho LimeTick Chronicle.) Yesterday morninit, at 7 o'clock, a for­ midable body of labourers, to the amount of 400, after proce.eding to tho new line of road leading to Mungret, where-they expected to have obta.iued work, but with­out success, paraded the streets with spades, shovels, and hammers, for the purpose of exhibiting their destitute con­diti-0n; at a period when the price of bread and oatmeal has reached a standard beyond the ordinary resources of alabour­ing man, whose earni~s average but 10d.. to ls. a day for himself and family. Having passed down George's-street, objects of commiseration and pity, they proceeded throqgh William-street to Jolm's-square,the residence of the Mayor, tu whom they were anxious to represent. their disappointment and wants ; but his worship not being at home, they were retiring, when a bread ca.rt, belonging to Mr. J. N. Russell,'which was su{?plying dealers, happened to pass, upon w1nch the crowd rushed agaiust it in a menacing attitude, and plundered all the contents, which were soon devoured by the hungry multitude. Soon after, a second bread cart, the property of Mr. Ryan,of Brurea, drove up, and was also quickly rifled of its provision in like manner. Sub-inspector Williams immediately communicated the outrage to the local magistrates and Colonel Mansel, and despatched mounted orderlies to the out stations for an aug­mentation of constabulary, a precaution which thiti preliminary outbreak fully warranted. The Mayor, Mr: John Crips, and Colonel Mansel, were soon in attend­ance at the police-office, where applica­tion was made by parties from different flour and baking establishments for protection, which request was imme­diately complied with. In the mean­time a detachment of the 8th Hussars was caUed out to patrol the street, and were hooted as they passed along. The Mayor, indignant at the violentoutrageon private property in the public streets, tolcl the crowd that while he was most desirous to procure them employment, and had left nothing. nndone to relieve their distress, he was fully determirilld to suppress and punish any further lawles, manifestation ; and if they had patience for a few days (cries of ""vVe can't starve,"") they would certainly procure employment and food. Much alarm was felt for two hours after, but ultim,tely the labourers dispersed, stating they would "" hold out "" a day longer. A special private meeting of the _magistrates was held at 12 o'clo<Jk-the Mayor presiding. Colonel Mansel also attended. We under.,b.nd a memorial to the Lord-Lieutenant was adopted, urging the absolute necessity of immedi ,te employment for the destitute labouring classes, representing the impossibility of the low male of wages (Sd. to 10d. a daiyJ laid down by the Board of Works being adE_lquate to procure sufficient £cod for their families, and advi;:ing opening the Government stores for the rnle of Indian corn, in order to reduce the high and advancing prices charged for provisions. A resclution was also passed, warning the stewards of the intendAd race meeting at Newcastle of the danger to be appre bended by bringing a multitude of persons together at a crisis when famine threat.ens the land, and recommending that they should abandon or defer the race meeting. The Mayor and magistrates, aided by the military authorities, r-ave taken the necessary precaution of holding the troops and gnrison ready for duty when called upon ; and last evening the Alban war steamer, lying at Harvey's­quay, near the Ferry-slip, mounted addi­tional pieces of brass ordnance. This morning the labourers again proceeded in a body to the Mungret road, where several wei;lil put to work by Mr. Kearney, county surveyor. Those who did not get employment again paraded the streets, bnt-in a quiet and orderly manner. The magistrates were on the alert, and the city police, under Mr. Williams, mustered in their barrack, William-street, ready to turn out should their services be re­quired. (From the. Waterford Ohh,nicle.) There was an immense multitude of the rural population of the surrounding dis­tricts gathered into town, who became most outrageously tumultuous. The con­duct of Mr. Howley, the resident magis­trate, is above all praise on this trying occasion. To his cool decision, prompt attention, judicious disposal of the force under his command, and humane for­bearance, under most irritating circum­stances, in disper2ing a reckless multi­tnde, without the slightest injnry to any person, save himself and some of his men, who were struck with stones, too much praise c:rnnot be given, and also to the officers and men under his command. The Catholic curate, Re, . Mr. O'Gorman. exerted himself most effectually to cause the people to retire quietly to their homes, seconded by his reverend confrert, Mr1 Mooney. The military and con,, stabulary, under Mr. Howley, paraded the town until evening, at which time il was quite clear-not an individual of the unruly multitude to be found. The cause; principally, of this outrageous COllP duct was an impre~sion prevalent amoJ!I them that their 1vages were to be reduceil to 8d. or 10d. per day. The gathering of such a multitude was caused by si~nal fires blazing from hill to hill the prev1oa1 evening. It was calculated to do ni, good. There ,,'as not a gentleman at the sessions ignorant of the state of th labouring poor, and surely an appeal t their humanity, and not to their feal'tlt would baY-e been more honourable to th parties advising such a clemonstration-­a demonstration showing the ,danger of unnecessarily getting together such an unruly multitude ; for, indeed, the numerous attendance of lnagistrates and ratep,yers was proof of a disposition to do everything possible to relieve the. people.

B. Their Lordships also suggest that, in order to obviate inconveniences which may hav~ been experienced, during the late relief operations~ the following alter­ations 1:1hould be made in the instructions under which the local relief committees liave hithiirto acted ~­ -First, with regard to the assistance given by the relief committees in the :f>roper appropriation of the relief pro­dded under the 10th Victoria, cap, 107, by means of public-works,­That tickets should not. hereafter be issued by the relief committees entitling persons' to employment on su&h . public works. That, instead thereof, the relief 6thnmittees should furnish (according to *farm to be supplied to them for that purpose) the officers in charge of the worlrs, on the part of the Board of Works, fflh 4ists of persons requiring relief, nating them in the order ill: ' which they a.re cpnsidereq to be entitled to priority, ~if/lier on account of their large families, qr<from any other cause; that the com­ifiilitees should revise these lists from time to!;,time as occasion may require; and fhat:tlie officers of the Board of Works, acting on. the information oontained in llhl:lse: list!!, or ac:piired by them from other sonrcea; should themselves furnish tickets en,titling p~rsons to employment on' the relief works for certain hmifud periods, according to tl1e circumstances of $ijh case. -1Secondly, as regards the functions per­Corme_d by the relief committees, indepen­ifently, of:the retiefworks-carried on under the provisions. of .Ac~ of Farliamen~,­'.lb.eir Lordships consider that donations in aid of private subscription may be malde,--when necessary, as heretefore, £tom public funds placed for that pur­)10se at the disposal of the Lord-Lieu­tenant; and that these donations may cofltinue to be; as a general rule, in the proportion of from one-third to .one-half ~'the amount of the, private subscrip­tions, acaording to the extent of.the desti­t\ttion and the means of the subscribers. ,But, ~heir 1!ordships are <!f opinion that, 111-' consideration of the assistance so to be gwei1 from the public purse; the pro­ceedings of the relief committees, in the approp:riatipn ofthe funds.administered by them, should be sa bjected to any degree of control on the ,part of the Government that may be considered desirable ; for which purpme their accounts and corre­spondence should at all times be open to the inspection of Government officers ap­pointed for-the purpose, and any further explanations that may be required on any particular point sh:iuld be immediatelyfurnished. In order to keep in check, as far as pos­sible, the social evils incident to an ex­tensive system of relief, it is indispen­sably necessary that the relief committees should not sell the meal or other food P.ro­vided by them, except in small quantities to persons who are known to have no other ll).eans of procuring food ; that the price at which the meal is sold should, as nearly as possible, be the same as the market prices which preva.il~in the ,neigh­bourhood ; that the committees should not give a higher rate of wages nor exact a smaller quantum of work, in any works carried on by them from funds at their own disposal, than is the case in respect to the works carried on und.er the super­intendence of the Board of Works, and that works should be carried on by them only to the extent to which private_ em­ployment is proved not to be available. The serious attention of every person who will have to take a part in the ll).easures of relief rendered necessary by the new and more complete failure of the p9tat_o ~rop sho:iild be particula~l:f: ca,Ued to this 1mporta11tfact; that the hmita.t1ons and precautions which have been pre­scribe.d to .the Government .boards and officers in carrying out the :relief opera­tions, with ~he object of .rendering the necessary interference with the labour and provision markets productive of the smallest possible distur banoe _of the or dinary course of trade and industry, will be rendered nugatory if the same /ru~dance and reserve are not _practise by the relief committees in the admi11istra­tiou of the funds placed ,at their disposal by :private or public benevolence ; and their Lordships therefore feel it to be their duty earnestly to request that every person concerned will,to-the extant of the influence possessed by him, endeavour .to aecure such a restriction of -th& measures of relief to cases of real destitution, and such a just considerttion for the interests of merchants ~nd dealets,in the free exer­ci8'l of whose callings the public welfare is so deeply concerned, 'that, instead of the habitual dependence upon charitable aid which might o~herwise be appre- bended from the extensive measures of relief in progress, every description of trade and industry may be , stim?1ated by, them, and the bonds of : society ma:, become more fij'mly knit by the ..benevo lent and intelligent co-opera;tion of the different orders and: ranks .:of""which it is ccimpo sed to avert a common calamity, and to pr.,pare _for re-commencing the ordinary occnpations of social life with advantages which are at present only im­perfectly enjoyed in some parts of Ire­land. 'l'he limited grant fund provided by the 10th Victoria, cap. 109, entitled "" An Act to authorize a further issue of money in.aid of public works of acknowledged utility in poor districts in Ireland,"" is, according to the terms of the Act, ap~ plicable only to the case of unimproved districts, like parts of the counties of Kerry, Galway, Mayo, i.nd Donegal, wr.ere, although the roads and other works would be productive of inore than usual public advantage, the districts are too poor to bear the whole expense of them ; and the Act therefore directs that in cases in which the repayment of loans to the am:mnt of at least a moiety of the estimated expen,e of such works shall have been secured, and such further con­tributions shall have been made as the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury sliaU think fit to require from the in­dividuals principally interested in the pro­jected works, such aid shall be afforded from this fund; in the shape of grants, as_ the occa!'lion may appear to require. The applications which may be received for grants under this Act will have to be carefully ~:-:~mined and in~uired into by the Commissioners of Pnbhc Work~, who will recommend or sanction those works which appe1,r 'to them to co1ubine the greatest public utility with the relief of urgent distress, taking care that the pro­prietors specil!,lly interested are required to contribute, in addition to their share of the gener,1,l assessment for the repayment of half the expense of the works, sums proportioned, in some degree, to the special benefits they will derive from them. My Lords have considered, with the careful attention which the importance of the subject demands, the measures proper to be taken with a view to continue the late commissariat operations to the ex­tent which may bA absolutely necessary for the pi1rpose of providing supplies of food fo-r sale in districts to which the ordinary operations of the provision trade cannot .be expected to extend,the strictest regard being at the same time paid to the pledge which has been given, not to interfere in any case in which there is a re isonable expectation that the market will be supplied by mercantile enterprise, a,nd they wil! proceed to state the course which appears to them to be the best adapted to secure the importan~ object in view. Their Lordships have already given directions that no portion of the stock of meal remaining in store in the dilferent depots should be suld merely for the sake of disposing of it. It has been fully established, by the experience of the late operations, that the ports on the -northern, eastern, and southern coasts, from Londonderry _to Cork, and those parts of theinterior which are ordinarily supplied from them, may safely be left to the foresight and enter­prise of private 'm_erchants, and it will only be necessary for the Governmenti, so hr as this part of Ireland is concerned, to take effectual precautions that tl:e sup­plies introduced by P""ivate traders from abroad are properly protected, both while they are in transit and when they are stored for future . consumption ; and for this purpose their Lordships rely upon the Lord-Lieutenant making every neces­sa1 y arrangement in coiumunication with the Commander of the Forces in Ireland; and the Inspector-General of the consta­bulary force. - _ _ , ; Acting on this principle, theirLord~ ships have directed_ that the -supplies of food now in store should be concentrated without delay at the following dep6ts :~ In the Interior-Longford, Bartagher. On the coast-Limerick, Galway, West port, Sligo. And Commissary-General Hewetson has been instructed to take immediate steps for the transfer of t!ie quantity remaining in store in the depot at Cor:k to Limerick, in the charge of which de-pat he will relieve Commissary-General Coffin, who will remain on foll pay with a view to his being employed hereafter as the occasion may require. - , Subordinate depots will be established, under the _charge of the constabulary, at other places on the western coast, as, the necessity for taking such a step may become apparent. Their Lordships desire that it may 'be fully understood that even at those places at which Government depots will be established for the sale of food, the depots will not be opened while food can be ob tained by the people from the private dealers a-treasonable pricfls; and that;even when the depots are opened, the meal will, if possible, be sold at such prices as will allow of the private trader selling at the same price with a reasonable profit; The Relief Commission ceased on the B2 15th instant, since which period Com-1¢ssary-1:leneral Sir Randolph Routh has continued to transact such business as l'equired immediate attention ; and con­sidering the experience which has been ~uired bythatofficer and his well-proved ,-bility for the task, their Lordships.are of e>pinion that the duties confided to the ~ef commission during the last opera­;f;.iollS, may, with great public advantage, :Ile mtrusted to Sir Randolph-Routh, acting under the authoriiy of the Lord­J;.ieutenant. and in constant communica­;tion with this Board. Their Lordships have taken steps to pocure the early anival in .this country, jrom the stations. where they are em­ ployed abroad, of a sufficient number oi well qualified commissariat officers, not only to take charge of the depots which it has been determined to retain,but al&o, under the orders of Sir Randolph Routh, to communicate with the local relief committees, and to afford, through him, to Her Majesty's Government correct in­ formation as to the state of the districts in which they will be stationed. Measures have also been taken for strengthening the Board of Works, to enable it to meet the coming emergency, on which subj.act a separate _communica tion will this day be made to the Board of Works and his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant.",TREASURY MINUTE ON RELIEF WORKS,4,9/21/1846
"INDOLENT PREFERE~CE OF REL!EF TO LABOUR. (LEADING ARTICLE, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 1846.) , : The worst symptoms of the Irish 'famine have begun to show themselves in 'the way of popular gatherings and pro­'Qel!'sions, which at present are only turbu­~1mt, but may soon become outrageous. The twin powers of Fear and Rumour :have lent their hands to the colouring of a. picture already sufficiently sombre. '.The people have made up their minds to :r.eport the worst and believe the worst. .Human agency is now denounced as in­ strumental in adding to the calamity ;inflicted by Heaveu. It is no longer sub­.~ission to PROVIDENCE; but a murmur :1,1,gainst the Government. The potatoes 'were blighted by a decree from on high, ::J~ut labour is defrauded by the machina­ tions of earthly power. Sqch are the fitat aspirations of discontent,inflamed by rµlllour, and diffused by fear. Such are,~e tpanks that a Government gets for r~ttempting to palliate great afflictions ~'.!ld satisfy corresponding demands by an inevitable but a ruinous beneficence. i .The alarm of the populace in the prin­cipaltowns has arisen in some cases from the fact of the wages paid by Government lI~ing below the average standard of W11-ges in the vicinity ; in others, from :the report that it is the intention to :teduce them below that standard. This is<t:Pe secret of the murmur. But how much dces it disclose ! How much does it indicate ! It is the old thing ; the old. grievance is at the bottom; the old xnalady is breaking out. It is the natio,nal chai:acter, the national thoughtlessness, lihe national indolence. It is that which demands the attention oi Govern­ment.s, of patriots, and philanthropists, not a whit less than the potato disease. The Government provided work for a people who love it not. It made this the absolute condition of relief. Doing so, it 011ly did that which every Executive is bound to do in simifar circumstances. But, in laying out its plan, it was obliged to, square the execution of it by the habits of the people. It knew that the latter woul:i at all tirnes rather be idle tfuip. toil ; would live on a small gratuity :mther than large or regular e~rnings ; and would trust to the beneficence of a Cabinet rather than to the sweat of their brows, or the steady work of their hands. Lt saw distinct.Iv the prospect of more than half a nation becoming complacently dependent upon specious alms. There was but one way to avoid a calamity com­pared with which the potato blight is a trivial thing. This was to enjoin that work, slovenly and sluggishly performed -as Government work was sure to be­should procure subsi~tence for the peasant, but nothing more. 'rhe Govern­ment was required to ward off starvation, not to pamper indolence ; its duty was to encourage industry, not to stifle it ; to stimulate others to give employment, not to outbid them, or drive them from the labour market. It therefore threw itself between the poor man and his gaunt foe ; but it would not interfere between. him and his best friend-the man who would employ him. It diminished the competition which the labourer had to fear ; it increased that which none but a foolish proprietor could dislike. It provided literally bread for the famished, but it held out more than bread to the active and industrious. The sr1uire and the farmer found that, in order to get labourers at all, they must appeal not only to the incligence,but the acquisitive­ness of the poor. The contest thus arose between the 8d. or 10d. a day of the Exeeutive and the ls. or ls. 2d. of the landowner. In England or Scotland­in any other country but Ireland-the issue would have been clear from the beo-inning. All hands would have te~dered their services to the squire or the farmer. The Government contractor would have been left to treat with the refuse of the population Private works would have enlisted youth, health,vigour, activity, and zeal. .The publk works would have devolved on age, infirmity, or indolence. But, in the end, the nation­the empire--would have gained. On the spur of a temporary emergency permanent improvements would have been effected and normal habits established. The .emu­lation of the peasant would have conspired with the ambition or the avarice of the landlord to ,redeem the soil of Ireland from the curse of perpetqal neglect, and the oondition of Irishmen from the shame of hereditary squalor. That which taught men first of all to work, would have taught Irishmen to work well, steadily, and continuously. Hunger would have been (as elrnwhere) the herald of comfort, Necessity the parent of luxuries. The dis­appearance of the potato, instead of being a curse, might have been hailed as a boon ; and the Celtic tiller eating better food and cultivating a nobler crop1 might have learned to wonder how he could ever have existed on so poor and innutritious a root. But what would happen in other coun­tries never does happen in Ireland. There the process as well as the motive of every action is inverted. Instead of in­creased exertion and renewed industry, passive submission and despondent indo­lence awailed a famine epoch. Even the annual migration of labour was suspended in many instances. The English corn­fields lacked their wonted reapers. The Celtic features and the Celtic dialect were missed from our northern :tnd east.em harvests. The quays of Liverpool and Bristol were unusually scant of thoE'tl strongly-marked lineaments and that peculiar garb which distinguish the native Irishman from every other -denizen of Europe. England was rife of variedemploy­nj.ent and .multiform speculation. Every hand that could be turned to account was pressed into service. Our own peasantry iere,. in many counties, insufficient to meet the demands of multiform occupa­tion. Still the Irishman-he who, in other and less happy seasons, has filched more than his share from the competition of his English fellow-labourer-he who was erst reviled as a pernicious rival, but who then would have been hailsd as a u seful ai;i.d kindly help mate-he kept aloof. Here and there yofl might hear the western brogue, but, almost univer­sally, the harvest wooed in vain..the .sickle of the sister isle. Why was this 1 Why was it that the prospect-the certainty of a great calamity, did not animate to great exertions 1 Alas ! tl_ie _Irish peasant had tasted of famine and found that it was good. He saw the cloud looming in the clistance, and he hailed its approach. To him i:t teemed with goodly manna and salienb watPrs. He wrapped himself up in the ragged mantle of inert expectancy, and said that he trusted to PROVIDENCE. But the deity of his faith was the Govern­ment--the manna of his hopes was a Par­liamentary grant. He callad his sub­mission a religious obedience, and he believed it to be so. But it was the obedience of a religion which, by a small but material change, reversed the primmval decree. It was a religion that holds ""Man shall not labour by the sweat of his brow."" All this was natural, and might ha-ve been expectted from the original character and antecedent conditions of the Irish people. It was the same rooted and innate disposition which thwarts, and bafiles,and depresses them wl1ithersoever they turn their steps. On tlw banks of the Liffey or the Liver, the Thames or the St. Law­rence, the Murray or the Mississippi, it is the same thing. It is this that prevents them from working when they can idle ; from growing rich when they work ; from saving when they receive money. It seems a law of their being-a hard, a pitiable, a saddening law ; but one hitherto un­altered, and-we hope only to external appearance-unalterable. But why is it that in Manchester, or Leeds, or Stock­port, when bi works and is well paid, the Irishman never thrives 1 'lhe Englishman and the Scotchman from small beginnings struggle into comfort, respectability, competence ; rn1y, sometimes even into wealth and station. The Scotch orEnglish spinner, in no few cases,Jms become a manufacturer andc a capitalist ; the Irish hardly in any.

He remains, if not poor, at least uncomfortable. His family inherit the squalid slovenlineEs which their father imported. His quarter -as may be seen in Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Oldham, or Drury-lane­is always the mo1,t forlorn and cheerless in the district. All.these things are facts beyond doubt anddenial. We repeatthem notfor reproach or contumely, but to show that there are ingredients in the Irish character which. must be modified .and corrected before -either individuals or Governments can hope to raise the general condition of the people. It is absurd to prescribi:l political innovations for the remedy of 'thS:ir sufferings or the alleviation of their wants. Extended suffrage and municipal reform for a peasantry who have for centuries consented to alternate between starvation 011 a potato and the -dolF>s of nationa1 charity ! You might as well give them bonbons and ratafias. Nothing effectual can be achieved untU the habits of the people are changed. And this change cannot be effected unless the fand­owners a..'ld squireens exert themselves. '(l 2 Had the smaller gentry resident in Ire­sented by PLATO as correlative with, and land done their duty to their tenants and almost dependent on, a supply of the dependents-for the best landlords in Ireland are its absentees-had they set the example of attention to their proper­ties aud improvement of their estates, the Irish would long ago have repudiated the potato. Neglected by others, they neglected themselves. Hence the uni­versal prostration of self-complacent poverty and unrepining discomfort. We have a great faith in the virtues of good food. Without attributing the splendid qualities of the British lion wholly to the agency of beefsteaks, we may pronounce that a people that l1as been reared on solid edibles will struggle long arid hard against the degradation of a poorer sustenance. .The stomach is, more than the mind, a creature of habit. Accustom it to leeks or potatoes, it is indifferent to a generous diet. Once habituate it to substantial solids, it rebels against leguminous impostures. The consequence is obvious. Le ventre gouverne le molide, He who is in danger of being starved by idleness will make 0l)e 'more struggle to earn his bread, his beef, and his porter. On a question of this kind all agree. The philosopher and the gastronomist-SocRATES, AnEIMAN TUS, and ATHENJEUs-the framers of the Republic and the coterie of the Deipnoso­phists-concur in ascribing virtues, not orily physical, but moral and intellectual, to the excellence of man's food, and its variety. The study of justice and the proficiency in political science are repre­ finest grain and the most wholesome meats, For our own parts,we regard the potato blight as a blessing. When the Celts once cease to be potatophagi, they must become carnivorous. With the taste of meats will grow theappetiteforthem; with the appetite, the readiness to earn them. with this will come steadiness, regufarity, and perseverance ; unless, indeed, the growth of t,hese qualities be impeded by the blindness of Irish patriotism, the short-sighted indifference of petty land­lords, or the random recklessness of Government benevolence. The first two may retard the improvement of Ireland ; the last, continued in a spirit of thought­less concession, must impoverish both England and Ireland. But lJ-Othing will strike so deadly a blow, not only at the dignity of Irish character, but also the elements of Irish prosperity, as a con­federacy of rich proprietors to dun the national Treasury, and to eke out from their resources that employment for the poor which they are themselves bound to provide, by every sense of duty, to a land from which they derive their in­comes. It is too bad that the Irish land­lord should come to ask charity of the English and ,Seotch mechanic, in a year in which the ~.xport of produce to England has been beyond all precedent extensive and productive. But it seems that those who forget all duties forget all shame. The Irish rent. must be paid twice oyer.",INDOLENT PREFERE~CE OF REL!EF TO LABOUR.,2,9/22/1846

It arises from an over-population re­duced to the lowest point of subsistence by ignorance, improvidence, and lawless­ .ness. And who would gather from your columns that it has been for many years the great object of nearly every landed proprietor of consequence in Ireland to remedy this evil by promoting emigration, increasing the size of farms, educating the people, and that, fro;:.a these efforts, have sprung those calumnies which, alas ! :1.'he 'l'imes bas sent through Europe ?Who would suppose, from your articles, that Ireland contained such landlords a~ Lord Erne, a man whose sole pursuit and am­bition is not wealth or personal aggran­dizement, but the moral and social im­provement of his tenants ?-as the land­lords, whose estates are managed by Mr. BJacker, a man who has devoted a long and active life to the interest of the small farmers of Ireland 1-as Lord Devon, the late Lord Caledon, Sir Robert Ferguson, and hundreds more whose names crowd to my pen 1 These are men to be honoured far before any T~nglish landlord, however good ; not that they are by nature better or more liberal, but because the life of an Irish landlord, who strenu­ously attempts to improve the condition of his tenants, is one continued struggle against the vicious system impla11ted in the hearts of the people, preached from the altars by too many of the priests, through which the rights of property are rendered insecure by certain by-laws of the people, unknown to thb law of the land ; C?apital is driven away c'rom the country ; a man's qualifioations. are tested, not by his conduct, character, or c..eipital, but by his being a Saxon or a Celt, a Protestant or Roman Catholic. This is the system which makes, too often, the ignorant and vicious the advisers of the people, heaps calumny and outrage on those who would fain benefit .them, steeps Ireland in poverty, and makes Irishmen dependent on potatoes. There are, it is true, negligent landlords, like the Marquis of Conyngham in the reports of your !mmmissioner. Thero are kind but careless landlords, like Mr. O'Connell, whose.heavy avocations prevent his care of his estate ; but the crime of these men amounts simply to this-that while their care of their estates is not less than that of most English landlords, rn far as per­ sonal exertion is concerned, while their subscriptions to local charities are far larger in proportion, they do not spend their lives and expend their substance in the constant-generally thankless, often unproductive-effort to ameliorate, in spite of themselves, the condition of the people. And the check being absent, and the vicious system of Irish society having full play, the land is divided, sub-divided, worn out to the lowest possible point, want appears every spring, but a failure of potatoes is starvation for a year. Now,whence arises thisstateof things f Why is it that the common laws of profit and loss have not prevented or cured this evil 1 How is it that a .better system of cultivation is not found to be, as in England, a matter of profit 1 How is it that the landlord has not preserved farms of such a size, and tenants of such a capital, that there is a surplus left for rent,far mo:r;e for subsistence,even though one crop may fail 1 It arises, first, from past neglect, an evil fast being removed ; next, from the difference of religion of the owners of the soH and of the leaders of the people, the priests ; but, mainly and immediately, from the system I have referred to,­from the want of security of property, from the soil being the sole dependence of the people. Many and many a landlord has, at vast expense to himself, assisted to emigrate hundreds of people who, in defiance of the terms of some old lease, had fastened on his property-causing, perhaps, some present pr,in, but saving thereby, in the course of years, an incredible amount of human suffering. And deep and loud have been the denunciations of those landlords from the altars by those whose dues were thereby diminished. Many a Saxon capitalist would have speculated in a country so favoured by nature as Ireland, and the exporis of Irelandwould have been purchasedby his money, and eaten by those whom he em­ployed, but that tfie English rights of propedy are not recognized by the Irish people.

"AN ANGLO-IRISHl\IAN. (LETTER TO THE EDITOR, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1846.) Sir,-The general terms in which the resolutions passed at Oastlebar in the County of Mayo on Saturday, the 12th inst., were conceived, has furnished you with materials to aim a heavy blow and great discouragement, in The 'l'imes of the 18th, to Irish landlords, by. a whole­sale denunciation. By the aid of your criticism, then, and some other industrious helps on this side 0£ the water, the phrase "" lrish landlord"" will soon become absolutely synonymous in the language with ""inhuman,"" or worse, if worse could exist. But an entire class should not be doomed to general odium, at least on the weak assumption that the general cultivation of the potato as the food of the Irish people is a selfish object with Irish proprietors, or is a benefit to them. I was never acquainted with any one who had a grain of ech1ea­tion and foresight that did not regard that circumsfance as a misfortune to the people, and the mode generally pursued in Ireland for the cultivation ohhe potato as most injurious to proper~y. If you want to denounce the crmt1on of 40s. freeholds up to the year 1825 (since when it would have been impossible to make one), as the indirect cause of an undue increase of population in a state of wretchedness, exert ,Your industry and the great resources of your popular journal to ascertain on whose estates that ,.vas practised ; and if you are disposed to visit the sins of others on the present pos­sessors, publish their names, or suggest tlie modern remedy of a Committee of the House of Commons to allot some recom­pense from them to tlie public, that, having-passed through tl1at ordeal, they may start fairly with others whoso estates were not so prostit11ted, of which latter cfass, in passing, let me rny, mine was one. But do not one day deaI out a kick at the landlords of Ireland, and again, on another, a deadly blow behind the ear, and I may eay,behind the back of the pro­prietary of the whole island, because oc­casionally, in the present crisis, the hasty wording of resolutions .in some locality may leave an opening for attack. It was impossible to read the able letters written by '!'he 'l'imes' agent last year, without befog convinced that the paper wished well to Ireland, and desired to inform the British public fairly on the state of its peopfa , but it is equally impossible to read the c,bservations in Friday's paper without being moved, and at least to notice them as most unfair. I have no more to do with Mayo than you have, but when you come down upon landlords (Irish, of course) in general as "" very unfortunately heartless, extravagant, and guilty of fully in that sense as well as their predecessors,"" I ask you this question :-If the greatest proportion of the est,1tes of such persons as are now teeming with an overg.rown population would have been not now so situated,but, on the contrary, had their farms properly divided and cultivated as farms should be, provided the perverseness of the oc­cupiers by almost general custom had not disregarded their own contracts, and sub­divided the lands confided to their pos­session under directly opposite conditions, made with providence and foresight to deter from conacre, and from a ruinous cultivation of and calculation on the po­tato, what becomes of the reasoning of your article in Friday's paper 1 I am sorry some abler hand has not been moved to remonstrate against these renewed.. attacks, .but I shall not be deterred, by apprehension of any ret.ort I may draw upon myself, from complaining of such monstrous injustrce. A dispassionate statement will meet the case. The Irish peasant, in the extreme west and south of Ireland, is not remarkable for foresigli t. You confide land to him, or, as the law terms it, he is put into pos­session of it, though he knows nothing of sound agriculture. He abuses that pos­session in every way. First, by bad cul­turn of everything except weeds,and next by subdividing it for marriage portions for his sons and daughters. In the lapse of a few years, therefore, a man's estate is so huckstered, sold, and resold against his wisheA, and in the teeth of contracts, that the propriet0r can hardly recognize his own. What is he to do 1 If his pro, perty be anything considerable, the people are in the military occupation of it, and having one interest they have one animus, that is, to rem!>in masters of it on their own terms. The Roman Catholic clmgy, too, have an interest in this state of things. They are, as every one knows, intimately conversant with the affairs of all the families of their flock. That marriages, births, and burials should go on merrily is their interest. I do not say this now to re­proach them with it, only the fact is so. lndeed, I once asked one of them why he married paupers 1 and he answered, "" If I did not, ::mother would."" So thus stand these !:natters. But what says the law, the wfoe law, the English law, in­:flicted upon us without the slightest refer! ence to the social relations of the people' whose dealings it is to regulate i The prejudices of English law, riveted by education in the minds of even Irish lawyers, disregard the experien,:e of country gentlemen, and both in and out of Parliament a suggestion stands a bad chance of being listened to u aless by their permissiQn. I much doubt, how­ever, if, under the meaning of ""knights and burgesses,"" it was ever originally in­tended that one of their learned profes­sion should have got into t,he House of Commons at all. Try and obtain that a power shall be vested in a local authority (as it is in' Scotland), to prevent the soil, the staple of the CQuntry, being the plaything for every ignorant pauper to carve, and ruin at his pl1,asure, who happens to be in momentary possession of it. Talk of pre­venting it-'' Oh no,"" the lawyer says, "" eject him-wait-let him half ruin you and himself, and then eject him."" This is just the folly and destruction the law creates,beoause who can eject in Ireland 1 or who will take land from which the population, however they may be to blame, have been ejected 7 But at last the learned profession must be forced to give way i means of summary prevention must be adopted, or it is an injustice, nothing less than infernal, to blame Irish landlords as the authors of a condition of things which is working out their own ruin. Parliament must provide that no occu­pation of any description of land in a country so exclusively agricultural as ~re­land is, may be encouraged or permitted by law therein, without certain and im­mediate securities to control and enforce contracts; that laxity of practice may not, as at present,necessarilylead tofraud,chi­canery, perjury, demoralization, and dis­turbauce ; that means shall be devised to have agreements promptly enforced, of which no man could complain ; that over­holding should be renderPdanoffence,andas much punishable as forcible possession is now considered to be ; that persons having a casual posrnssion of land may be re­strained in liminc from sub-dividing the property of other persons against the will anrl wish of the owners, and against the faith .of their own contracts, instead of, driving proprietors to the remedy of ejectment after the injury is done, which Irish tenants in many places now think; when used, ought to be resented by assas­sination. Parliament should also provide n:~ans to abridge or diminish the unblushing practice of perjury now so notoriously common in the Quarter Sessions Courts of Ireland, by the appointing of officers to take down evidence as it is delivered (where perjury is apprehended), to serve towards the ends of conviction. Again, that persons for ,Yhuse benefit or internst the owner or tenant of any land is com pellpd by threats or terror to surrender the same, may be held responsible, as parties now are who are guilty of taking a forcible possession, Short of this your Legislature, year after year, heaping burden upon burden on Irish landlords, and the Press adding contumely to these injuries, are confisca tion under pretexts, and nothing less, When you have helped to ruin thousands by bad legislation, other proprietors must t.ake their place, to be again the victims of the same system; but remember always that, if the respectable part of the Engs lish Press, .even though unwittingly, poisons British opinion against a suffering and injured class of their fellow-s11bjectfi, in Ireland, it is at the same time invol-. ving British interests to an immense ex~ tent, as much of the soil of Ireland is mortgaged to British capital, the land~ lords whereof are, to a great degree, ad, ministrators for those who have lent their money on the faith of the security of pro­perty, which it is the fashion of modern sympathy to attack through the sides of its proprietors. . During the late Lord Liverpool's Ad~ ministration 1 gave evidence before the Committee on Irish Disturbances, and foretold that, unless steps were taken to regulate the occupation of the soil, and not leave it to haphazard, these periodical famines would press with increased severity on the public purse the longer the consideration of the subject was poi:;t­poned, and both in and out of Parliament since that time I have pressed the matter upon the attention of every succeeding Government ; but have invariably been defeated by the black-letter gentlemen. Some years ago, when solicited by the late respected Mr. Purcell to become one. of the original members of the Agricul­tural Society, I answered, that until the law of landlord and tenant was put upon a footing of common sense, agricalture could at best but make a limping progress in Ireland, and that everything else, with that left undone, was beginning at the wrong end, and I declined it. At this moment, one-half of the province of Con­naught is reduced to absolute barrenness by the burning of the soil to force pota­toes, and in that part now the distress is the most intense. It could not possibly be otherwise ; but, as long as the gentle­men of the long robe, in and out of Par­liament, are to be the prmnnount judges of what is to be done, or left undone, the landed interest, great and small, will be the victims of their prejudices and of their ignorance. For the rest, the activity, the zeal, and intelligence which the resident gentry of Ireland exhibit to adapt the powers of the law to the crea~ tion of profitable labour,tlmt the advances made to them by A,rliament may Le honestly and duly repaid to the Treasury, are a sufficient answer to whatever else may b.e uncharitably charged upon them. The world will judge whether, under the present awful visitation, they are fnlfil­ling their duties to their God and their country. I am not afraid of any fair ap peal to public opinion which can be made. I am, Sir, your obedient servant. Dublin, Sept. 21.",AN ANGLO-IRISHl\IAN.,3,9/26/1846
"WESTlllEATH, (LEADING ARTICLE; SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1846.) The Marquis of vVEsnrnATH will see, by our insertion of his letter, that we are anxious to.do full justice to his class. As long as we observe the golden rule of letting all parties spea}, for themselves, we incapacitate ourselves from the com­mission of any real injustice. If he ima­gines that we have tabn too large a sweep in our censures, and charred on the whole proprietary of Ireland the folly exhibited by two or three meetings and resolutions of the class, we afford him an ;opportunity of clearing himself from. the :common vice and the common opprobrium, Of course we have 11ever meant to say that all Irish landlords aro lrnartless, ex­travagant, and foolish, or that the evils of that country, to all appearance as ancient as the days of t.ho elk and the mastodon, are the work of one ceptury of absentee landowners. Had we said any­thing,of the rnrt, some other passage in the very same paper would have been sure to qualify the apparent universality of the expression. We are so-unfortunate ll,S to have a quarrel in our time with every party involved in this ancient and incurable contention. The Imperial Legislature, the Orangemen, the Romish priests, the Anglo-Irish establishment, Mr,O'CoNNELL,the landlords,thepeamnts, Whig and Tory, and we lmow not who besides, have all assumed, in their tnrn, the honour of bAing the single object of our crigi.inations. Vie may safely ask them""""to settle among thRmselves which has been the most reflected upon, It is our consolation th2""t, on the whole, after a thousand r@ewals of the illimitablfl controversy, our course rg,mains justified by that public opinion w11ich sees no alternD,tive but to distribute the blame. Ask any ordinary man-you might almost appeal to the next man you meet in the streets-and, after five minutes' reflection or embarrassment, ho will answer that he thinks there is nothing to choose between the whole lot. If the Marquis considers that we have swamped the meritorious exceptions by our manner of referring to the prevalent vices of the class, we must .beg him to reflect that the individual here always labours under the difficulty of st:.mdin"" out, by his own exertions, above th% dreary average of men. Paiici qiws CEthera virtiis, &c. If the noble writer will peruse his own letter with that im­partiality which its appearance in our columns may possibly inspire, he will perceive, by an example, for _which he will be disposed to make every allowance, the cliflfoulty of combining justice to in­dividuals with a brief and emphatic de­scription of parties. It is true that he recognizes with sufficient discrimination the Axistence, of some resident, en­liglltened, and generous landowners. Whe11, however, he comes to the Irish pearnnt, he says, with a force which we admit would have. been impaired by an attempt at qmtlification, that '' he knows nothing of sound agriculture ; "" that if you put him in possession of land, "" htJ abuses that possession in every way ;"" that the only thing he cultivates with success is weeds ; that he breaks con­tracts, and, the. people being all one interest and animus, retains possesdon by public combination and violence aga,inst the landlord. When he comes oo the priests, he says wlll\t is unhappily too true in the main,-that, putting all other considerations, human or divine, out of the question, these spiritual pastors consult their own interests in the matter, which is, that "" marriages, births, and burials should go on merrily."" \Vhen he comes to the English law, he says that "" it is inflicted upon us without the slightest reference to the social relations of the people whose dealings it is to regu­late ;"" and that "" the experience of country gentlemen,"" in particubr is set at nought by "" the prejudices of English law, riveted by education in the minds of even Irish lawyers."" The Imperial Legislature he describes, without any µieasures of a contrary tendency, as "" heaping burden upon burden on Irish landlords ; "" and the Press as ""adding contumely to these injuries."" It is perfectly allowable to make such statements, and it would be ,very unwise to ccmplain of Lheir general character, when the memory of every well-informed reader will at once throw in the requisite granum salis with which they are to be Understood. An ordinary degree of can­dour will excuse even the announcement, apparently so sweeping, that, ""as long as the gentlemen of the long robe, in and out of Parliament, are to be 'the para­ mouut judges of what is to be done, or left undone, the landed interest, great and small, will be the victims of their prejudices and th6ir ignorance."" \Ye are not aware of having exceeded ourselves the limits of that canchd and reasonable interpretation which Lord WESTMEATH himself desenes and re­quires. If, however, we rnem to have pressed rather hard on the landowner; we mustappeal,inself-defence,totheimmemo­rial tradition of England, which co;nsiders the la.ndowner responsible for the welfare of the tenantry and labourers on his soil. Superstitious as this may be, it is a noble and living remnant of that useful feudalism which existed amongst us even before the days of WILLIAM or of ALFRED, and which has refined the temper and tnoulded the institutions of this island. Ireland, it is true, has never passed through the fiery and purifying_ furnace of the feudal system. From age to age it ha!1 exhibited the afflicting spectacle of an agrarian democracy. We in Eugland are, perhaps, too apt to. judge her by .the rules and graces of a patriarchal code. We .forget the commercial ideas that belong to the "" plantation."" \Ve expect the landlord to show not only a rent-roll, but high cnltivatio:u, substantial houses and habit~ble cottages, well-stored farm­yards, substantial yeomen, contented bbourers. 'Ibis is an English prejudice.1. though we are aware how apt it is to bi'!' disn,ppointed by sober reality. We will not, however, resign it. We even enforce it. 'Io he a resident, an improving, a generous landlord, is supposed to be necessary to the character of an English gentleman. The ablest stat&sman would find himself damaged by the belief that he neglected his local and pt,trimonial duties. ""\Ve expect the same, unreason­able as the expectation may seem, from the Irish landowner. "" Show. us your model e8tate. Let us see your tenantry, your labourers, your houses, your cot­tages, your farms."" Perhaps we demand too much ; but it is the English, the im­ perial standard. ­ Lord WESTilfEATH considers that the great flaw in British legislation for Ira­laud is the ,vant of a mote real and effec­tual enforcement of the rights of pro­perty. Certainly he describes a state of things not very creditable to the law. It is not law, it is anarchy, when a tenant openly and audaciously violates his con­tract, subdivides his land among sons, relations, and squatters, and by the help of a multitude of similar delingnents refuses to give up possession of the land. 'Ihis amounts b what his Lordship calls ""'military occupation."" The question is, how can sufficient powers be given without offending the free genius of tJ10 British Constitution, ancl without also creating the still. more practical evil of an expensive and demoralizing "" military occupation "" on the part of the landlord and the law. It is a question of possi­bilities. Can it be done 1 We feel in­clined to fear that the chief remedy his Lordship proposes will not be generally considered to illustrate the facility with which the object may be attained. When he says, "" Parliament should provide that persons for whose benefit or interest the owner or tenant of any land is com­pelled by t.hreats or terror to surrender the same may he held responsible,"" he introduces a principle to which the least objection is the utter impossibility of its enforcement in any British tribunal and which would, therefore, cruelly multiply the defeats which his Lordship already complains of at the hands of the "" black­letter gentlemen."" But is it a fair answer to say that, in the existing state of Ireland, it is impos, sible to screw up the rights of property to the English pitch 1 The answer is ad­mitted in a parallel case. It is thought quite fair and sufficient when the duties of property are concerned. 'l'o the pro­position of the Poor Law-not the present atrocious system, as exemplified at Andover and elrnwhere, but a real, merci­ful legislation for the wants of the poor-­it.is replied,with triumph,-""But it would swallow up the rental."" we only ask that the two may stand or fall together. If the landlords demand the rights, let them submit to the duties of their posi­tion. If there i3 to be military occupa­tion, let there be also an available system of employment and relief. We confine ourselves to the capabilities of the subject. We say the one rlemands the other. If we are to send over an army to Ireland to oust the interloping pea­santry from their miserable squattings and subdivisions, whither are we to send them ? TherA is the question. To the road side ? '.l'o the pestilential suburb of the crowcled town ? To the seaports ? To the noya,des of the dreary Atlantic ? Noble service this for an Anglo-Irish army ! l'erhaps also possible ! No. When something in the nature of a refu5e is provided, when poverty has its alter­native, then will be the time t'.) think of more rigorous laws of property. Do not import the English system into Ireland by halves.",WESTlllEATH,2,9/26/1846
"THE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMEN~ (LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1846.) 'fhe position of the Minister whom the progress of events, the struggles of party, the working~ of public opinion, and even the vicissitudes of the sky have conspired to place at the head of this rrnlm, is one which-a moralist might select to cure the most insatiable and most daring ambition. In the approaches of a famine, aggravated by a social dis­order which e;enturies have been nursing, it is his tremendous responsibility to hold the key of the national store. -A few years-almost a few months-since, it was pdnted out to the admiration of Eng­land that the manufacturing' masses of Lancashire, deprived of employment, sat down to die in sight of warehouses full to overflowing with food. That was a noble spectacle, and it has told. Resignation bas wrought a miracle such as the boldest agitators did not venture to expect. Would that either the case were as simple, the remedy as obvious, the people as resigned, in the present in­stance. An island, a social state, !t race is to be changed. The surface of the land, it_s divisions, its culture, its pro­prietors, its occupiers, its habitations, its manners, its law, its language, and the heart of a people who for two thousand years have remained unalterable within the compass of those mighty changes which have given us European civiliza­tion, are all to be created anew. That is only part of tlie task which a destiny that Beems t-0 mock alike the aspirations of benevolence and of ambition, imposes on the Minister of this State.. Re has not only to feed the people out of an insuffi­cient store, but change their very nat,ure meantime. Should 110 fail both to meet the crisiR and improve the opportunity, he will be reproacheq not only with the horrors of instant famine, but with help­ing to perpetuat'e a national degradation. l'ity for a task so far beyond the powers cf man teaches us to spare that discursive variety of suggestions which can m~ly bewilder and cannot inform. Would that we could impress this lesson on the whole multitude of volunteer ad­visers of tho Crown. Perhaps it is use­less to ask the great Agitator for one short month to descend from his hobby ; to ask ,the landlord to forget his rights, and the tenant his wrongs ; or to entreat all parties to agree to one brief truce of historical grudges. Still, at the risk of wasting our words, we will once ,more invite all to remember that it is not merely an Irish question, not a political question at all, we have to deal with. It is an economical question. How are the twenty-five millions of these islands to be carried through this twelvemonth, and safely into the middle of the next, on a seriously insufficient store, which it appears impossible mean­time to replenish ? The question only begins with Ire­land. All are concernEd, b 1t they who are actually perishing are the first to be considered. 'fhe Irish must be fed at once. That point is settled. But, that done, the graver matters of future suste­nance and future tranquillity cloud our horizon with dark and ominous ambig11ity. It is not merely the present failure of the potato, but the discovery that it is not to be depended upon, that we have to confront, to subdue, or to mitigate. There is a melancholy concurrence in the opinions of most Irishmen that five years at least must ehp3e before in any part of Ireland thepeasantry will be able to raise a new species of food. And even this hypothesis is made on grounds more favourable than a minute contemplation of the earn warrants us in assuming. Five years must elapse before even the more docile and. tractable portion of the peasantry will be able to cultivate a new and different species of food. But how long a period must intervene before the more intractable, the nrnre impatient, and the more despondent part of them habituate themselves to the idea-much more to the study-of a novel and un­wonted agriculture ? A length of time­graater than we like to revolve in onr minds-must pass over ere the til­lage be changed and the subsistence of the people created afresh. what is to be done in the interval 7 Already the com­plaint is that the baronies have overtaxed themselves ; that they are assessed to the labour-fund far above their actual value. Th~s by itself would be found to be a serious inconvenience, were the calamity whwh it is proposed to obviate of a tem­porary nature. But this is not so. 'rhe most sanguine dare not hope that one year will bound the sweep and severity of our affliction. The remedy, therefore, which applied to the first year's evil would be inconvenient is, when proposed for the second, impossible or ruinous. To repeat the process of super-taxation-to renew the great promissory note to Government -would be simply to begg!tr the land­owners without conferring a permanent benefit on the people, or, what is equally important, a permanent improvement on the land. The landlords would fly from -while their tenants would perish on­a soil exhausted by mortgages and crowded with a famished and reckless population. Frightful as such a state of things would be, it is no vague picture of tI1e imagination: It is just the very state to which Ireland must inevitably be re­duced, if the sums now collected, and about to be colleded, are flung away on works which will add noLhing to the national wealth, and supply nothing to the national want. The first object of Government, after dqing the best, as we admit Lord BESS BOROUGH seems k> be doing, for the im­mediate exigency, should be fo provide against its certain recnrrence ; to devise means for making the famine of the next year less oppressive than that of the present, and that of the following easier than that of the next ; so that the weight of suffering may be diminished season by season, until PROVIDENCE has blessed the industry of the people and the enetgy of their advisers by new modes and new fruits of husbandry. This ca,n only be effected by taking such measures as shall insure the cultivation-the renewed, the general, and the indefatigable cultivation -either of such grain as may itself feed. the people, or be exported as the medium of procuring for them a proper food. To this object the attentioD both of Govern­ment and of landed proprietors should be directed. In this, as in eV6ry other emergency which demands vigour of design and promptneos of execution, the plans of tho landlord will be thwarted and his directions contravened by the in­extricable perplexities which beset the Irish question. That we must expect. There will be difficulty beyond what Englishmen find it easy to conceive in in­dncing the Irish peasant to till acres for the reception of other crops than the potato. Will the difficulty be too great for the landlord to overcome 1 Will' it be great enough to shift upon the Government ? This problem must sooner or later be solved. Government has become a large money­lender. It may have to become so again even on a more comprehensive scale. But it hardly appears as yet that Govern­ment has succeed8d in getting that which ordinary money-lenders never fail to obtain-security. Suppose the land;. owners find themselves unable to repay 'ivhat has been advanced them by Parlia: ment-and this is no extravagant sup­position-what then ? What remedy will the Government have 1 None that we can see ; at least, none that would be worth a moment's effort, or a farthing's, outlay. But, if the money now advanced. by the Treasury be sacrificed to project~ of lavish but useless expenditure-to the construction of trafficless roads and ship:. less harbours-or to the mere equipment of private luxury and comfort-then indeed will the stewards of the Imperial purse have complicated a great teinerit~, with a great injustice, by lavishing awa:,, loans without a guarantee either for their discharge, or their safe and profitable investment. It has, therefore, been suggested, that Government r,hould constitute itself a mortgage~ on a large seals, and should itselfenter on the lands which ithasrelioved by its advanc2s, leaving, of course, to the proprietor his equity of redemption. That such a scheme should have been thought of for one moment only proves the desperate character of the emergency. Nothing, in fact, could ""be more contrary to the genius of a constitutional Government, which llirns tr. be an impartial arbiter between all classes, and never drncends from th0 council-room to occupy the place of any subordinate vocation. A British Premier will probably feel as great a scruple to play the part of a national landlord as to intrude into the office of Judge. Snch a scheme would, in faet, only be adding new elements of disorder to a chaos which already confesses the presence of too many. Henceforth the national landlord, the natio1ml tenant, the national agent, natiomt! leases, national processes of distress, would be added to the dramaI-is personw that already so uncomfortably crowd the stage. If so much is now expected from the worth, the ability, and forbearance of the private landowner, what extravagant expectations would usher in the reign of the national proprietor ! But it is easier to raiso ob­jections to such a scheme than to refute them. The Scriptural character of the precedent claims for it at least a decorous reception. But it would be difficult to esk1,blish a parallel between the patient children of HAM, the PHARAOHS, and the Delta of the Nile, on the one hand, and the Celt, the British ""Government, and the Emerald Isle on the other. VVe can only class the scheme with those dreamy projects which, impracticable as they may be in themselves, like the mysterious gleams of .morning twilight, do at least prepare for great changes. And he must indeed be blind who does not see that the present relation of rich and pvnr in Ire­land must precede some great revolution in the tenure of landed property.",THE DUTY OF THE GOVERNMEN,2,10/9/1846
"FOOD EXPORTS FROM !RELAND TO ENGLAND. (LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1846,) The British islands, small as they are in compsrison either with the sway of which they are the head-quarters, or with the neighbouring continental empires, contain within themselves the materials for some of the most remarkable problems the face of all this earth can supply. It is true that we do not suffer either the blot of legal slavery, or its bitter results in a domesticated negro population ; our plar.­ta,tions are not fringed with Caffres or Red Indians ; our downs are not scoured by Bedouins or Calnmcks ;our conquerors .and our conquered are not wholly un­mixed. So far there seems no discrepancy which a few generations might not be thought enough to overcome. Yet, within 24 hours of this great metropolis there are differences which, as to their substan­tial weight and effects,may well compare to the more picturesque diversities to which we have alluded. England and lreland, each as a whole, are as strange opposites, as fertile subjects for speculation, as in­explicable an enigma to the statesm:in, as the city of the CZAR and the half-con­tinent of serfdom by which itis sustained. .As is commonly the case with the greatest questions, some degree of dis­tance is necessary to a just 'estimate of relative positions occupied by theso two portions of the empire. The benefit of distance is enjoyed and freely used by our neighbours. Every politician of Europe is able, and always ready, to discuss the Anglo-Hibernian controversy with a free­dom of opinion and a largeness of view almost intolerable even to the most liberal-minded Englishman. We do not stop to inquire how far jealousy, ever searching for blots on the escocheon of greatness, has seduced the foreign spec­tator into an impracticable and unreal estimate of our internal relations ; nor will we ask how far England may retaliate the reproach. Such, however, is the largeness of survey to be acquired, or at least to be witnessed, in a brief sojourn among another people, language, and laws. It can, too, he predicted with certainty that distance of tinie will have a corre­sponding effect. The historian of future ages will review the quarrel of the Saxon and the Celt with wonderful impartiality. He will visit upon our own heads t!1at noble simplicity of survey, that unsparing generosity of sentiment, with which we are accustomed to treat the outrages and tyrannie, of classic or of medirnval anti­quity. If we hope to anticipate, and perhaps to avert the judgment of posterity, it is our place to aim at this distance. It must be obtained by an effort of the mincl, by a comprehensive and resolute grasp at all the conditions and fact8 of the question. Nor can we doubt that the question is now on the point of receiving a far more dispassionate and comprehensive survey. To this hope we are encouraged by the fact that many other social questions have lately received a similar emancipation. For example, we are now able to perceive and lament how many items our fore­fathers omitted in computing the losses and gains of our colonial empire, on a protective~system. We see how seriously they were impos11d upon by the fallacy of an upper current of fictitious advantage. The Irish question is equally treacherous to a superficial snrvey. When futtire economists strike the balance of favours and duties between England and Ire land, they will probably scrutinize the traffic of the Irish Channel more closely than wa are wont to do. They will insist much on the fact that the food of millions will annually pass to the richer and happier shore. They will not reconcile this with the alleged improvidence oi the Irishman quite so easily as we are wont to do. They will inquire very diligently what England gave in return. When their researches bring them to that crisis which we are now actually suffering, they certainly will be struck, perhaps even unduly, by the fact that while England was avowedly feeding Ireland-while both countries agreed in that view of their position-while all classes of Irishmen w:ere flinging themselves more and more upon the bounties of the empire, whole fleets of provisions were continually arriving from the land of atarvation to the ports of wealth and the cities of abundance. Scarce a day passes without every great port of this country seeing this visible contradiction, or rather this painful anomaly. We are emphatically reminded that it is not to Ireland her­ self, but to her social state, that the famine is attributable. This is no ex­ aggeration, no paradox. What,' also, will the future historian feel when in the very columns which he is searching for the distracting and harrowing notices ofIrish destitution, he lights on such a paragraph as th:i;t which appeared in our yesterday's impression, and which, in fact, is only one out of the many we could quote from the last few weeks :­ "" No -1es3 than 16 ships arrived in the river Thames on Monday from the Irish ports, laden almost exclusively with food and provisions of various kinds,the produce of that country, having collectively 14,960 packages of butter, 224 packages of pork, 1,047, hampers and bales of bacon, several of hams, 140 sacks, 2,926 barrels, and 7,788 quarters of OP.ts, 434 packages of lard, 75 of general provisions, 40 of oat­meal, 44 of porter, 259 bo,ces of eggs, and a variety of other articles of lesser impor­tance, which it would be quite needle_ss further to particularize. Of these almost unprecedentedly numerous arrivals in one day from the sister island 5 were from Limerick, 1 from Belfast, 2 from Water ford, 1 from Galway, 1 from Kilrush, 2 from Dublin, 1 from Youghal, and 3 from Cork."" Of course, to a certain extent every well-informed person will be prepared for such an announcement, and will not feel his sense of . injustice or his humanity wounded. There are large agricultural districts of England which transmit to their wealthier or more populous neigh bourhoods supplies of provisions, which the poverty-Btruck producers might equally covet at home. The United States, independent as they are of British rule, may occasionally present the spectacle of feeding us out of their poverty. There is no inequality in an interchange of cloth­ing and food. Ireland might owe as. 'much to England as England to her, Ou the other hand, history suggests too many instances of Imperial, States subsisting, waxing fat and wanton, on the vital wealth of their dep endent provinces. It informs us of a certain tendency, under_ given circumstances, to a great irtequality of relations. So it is at least possible for_ a fertile and populous region to suffer a, perpetual drain of its-resources; Its vast population may do nothing but expedite the bounties of nature, and transmit her bounties, untasted, to meet the relentless demands of some foreign master. It is possible that there may be no equiva,-' lent, no return to be hoped, no debt to be repaid. This may, then, be the case of Ireland. This inquiry, we think, is now likeIJ to receive an ac~urate and authentic deter­ mination. It may be put in some such form as the following :-Suppose, for. the purposes of the calculation, that Ireland is an independent country. Its economists will frequently compare the value of its exports and imports. Should they find the balance against them, they will naturally conclude, in the first instance, that the country is in debt,and the excess against them is nothing else than the annual payment of the interest, Int.:> this debt, however, they will, of course, inquire, looking for either a formal, or at least a substantial existence. Of the former there must be some record. The latter,-viz., the n;a.l benefit freceived and discharged by a continual exportation of produce, must be capital in some shape or other invested in the soil. If there have been no real loan, no advance of money, no tangible assistance, no con­sideration received in any form,-if there are no wealth laid out on the land, no l'rtificial property fairly attributable to that relentless for-eign debtor, then it is hard to escape the inference that there exists some sort of oppression ; and that the excess of exports over imports is not the interest of a just debt,but the tribute of a weak and conquered realm.",FOOD EXPORTS FROM !RELAND TO ENGLAND,2,10/30/1846
"STATE AID TO PUBLIC WORKS. (SATURDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1846.) (FROM THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENT,) DUBLIN, OCT. 29. LETTER FROM LORD J, RUSSELL. ,The Even-ing Post, the Government organ, contains the following letter, addresseri by Lord J-ohn Russell to his Grace the Duke of Leinster :­i "" Downing-street, Oct. 17. ""My de9,r Duke,-'l'he Royal Agricul­tural Society, of which you are the head, 11ent a deputation not long ago to the Lord-Lieutenant., representing that, in­stead of public-works of an unprofitable nature, the baronies should have power tp undertake works of a useful and pr9fit­abl0 nature. It had been our hope and expect:J,tion that landed proprietors would have commenced works of drainage and other improvements on their own account, thus employing the people on their own estates, and rendering the land more pro­ductive for the future. In that case it would have been only the snrplus labour which would have been employed on roads, and ot~er works not immediately profitable. .. ,' "" The Act, however, was put in opera­tion; in the baronies in a spirit the reverse of that which I have described. It was taken for granted that the public works were the chief objects to be re­garded ; and proprietors began to calcu­late that, as so large a sum was to be , repaid from their estates, they should notj' be able to commence or even to continue, private enterprises for the improvement (iftheir own lands. . '(,When the case was brought before the Government by the Lord-Lieutenant, we lamented the wrongdirection in which the Act had been turned ; but, admitting the necessity of the case, and anxious to obtain the willing co-operation of the landlords, we authorized the Lord-Lieu­ , tenant to. deviate from the letter of the law, and gaYe our sanction for advances for useful and profitable works of a. private nature. But, after having in­curred this responsibility, I am sorry to. seB that, in several parts of Ireland, calls are made upon the Government to under­take and perform tasks which are beyond the power and apart from the duties of Government. "" For instance, it seems to be expected that we should not only pay an un­usual rate of wages, but that we should maintain in this time ofscarcity the usual price of food. A moment's thought will show that this is impossible. A smaller qua11tity of food is to be divided among the same number of human beings. It must be scarcer ; it must be dearer. Any attempt to feed one class of the people of the United Kingdom by the Government would, if successful, starve another part : would feed the producers of potatoes, which had failed, by starving the producers of wheat, barley, and oats, which had not failed. All that we have undertaken with regard_ to food, there­fore, is to endeavour to create a provision trade at fair mercantile prices, where no provision trade has hitherto existed, and where, without assistance, none might be willing to un:lertake a new and unpopular occupation. '' But that which is not p:>ssible by a Goverl).mant is possible by individual and social exertions. Every one who travels through Ireland observes the large stacks of corn which are the produce of the late harvest. There is nothing to prevent the purchase of grain by proprietors, or by committees, and the disposal of these supplies in shops, furnished on purpose, with flour rot a fairprice, with a moderate profit. 'l'his has been done, I am assured,in parts of the Highlands of Scotland, where the failure of potatoes has been as great and as severe a calamity as it has been in Ireland. "" There is, no doubt, some inconvenience attending even these modes of interfer­ence with the market price of food. But the good over-balances the e:vil. Local committees or agents of landowners can ascertain the pressure of distress, measure the wants of a district, and prevent waste or misapplication. Besides, the general effect is to bring men together and induce them to exert their energy in a social effort directed to one spot ; whereas the interference of the State deadens private energy, prevents forethought, and, after superseding all other exertion, finds itself at last unequal to the gigantic task it has undertaken. ! "" There are other questions, however, extending beyond the exigency of the day, which, it seems to me, demand the atten­tion of the landed proprietors of Ireland much more than that of the Government. "" It has been calculated that one-fifth of the cultivated land in Ireland has hitherto produced pofo,toes. After the present lamentable failure, what course is to be taken 1 Some men of science deem that the potato can no longer be relied upon as an article of food; others say that time may remove tlie disease, The editor of the Gardener'.~ Chronicle states that the explanation of the potato disease,founded on the hypothesis of some unknown miasma, cannot beaccept.,dassatisfactory; but neither can it be rejected, seeing how si$'nally all other explanations have failed. Seeing; then, that science fur­nishes us with no means of estimating the effects of the prevalent disease upon the potato plant in future years, it would be impossible for the Government, with any propriety, to give any advice to the owners or occupiers of land in Ireland. They must form their own conclusions from facts that are known and the ex­perience of the present and past years. "" It is clear, however, that potatoes cannot be relied upon as they have been hitherto. A cottier cannot hope to be able to pay a large rent for conacre, and the farmer cannot hope to obtain the cottier's labour by allowing him land for potatoes, which may probably fail. It is, therefore, a most important question for the people of Ireland, in what manner the deficiency of food is in future to be sup­plied. The nature of tho grain or root which is best adapted for this purpose ; the course C't husbandry which ought fo be followed ; tbe means of procuring seed ; all these are important problems,to which the attention of the Agricultural Society of Ireland cannot too soon be directed. "" One thing is certain ; in order to enable Ireland to _maintain her popula­tion, her agriculture must be ,greatly improved. Cattle, corn, poultry, pigs, eggs, butters, and salt provisions, have been, and will probably continue to be, her chief articles of export. But, beyond the food exchanged for clothing and colonial products, she will reqnire in future a large Sllpply of food of her own growth or produce which the labourer should be able to buy with his wages. In effecting this great change much good might ultimately be done. But, unless all classes co operate, and rnee~ the infliction of Providence with fortitude and energy, the loss of the potato will only aggravate the woes and s ufferings of Ireland. "" Such, then, is the great lesson which, by the influence of the higher classes, and of such good landlords as yourself, may be taught to the Irish people. They should be taught to take advantage of the favourable condition of the soil and sur­rounding sea; to work patiently for them­selves in their own country, as they work in London and Liverpool for their em­ployers ; to study economy, cleanliness, and the value of time ; to aim at improv­ing the conoition of themselves and their children. "" I would here conclude this letter, which is already too long, but I cannot do so without expressing my conviction that there is every disposition in persons of property in Ireland to meet their difficul­ ties fairly, and submit to any sacrifices which the public good may require. "" I remain, my dear Duke, yours very faithfully, H.J. RUSSELL. '' His Grace the .Duke .of Leinster, &c.""",STATE AID TO PUBLIC WORKS,1,10/31/1846
"RELIANCE ON STATE HELP. {LEADING ARTICLE, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1846.) The plot thickens in Irelan:!. It appears to be the order of the day that everybody shall do exactly that which he ought not to do. A sort of St. V1Tus's dance has seized the whole population, and made their limbs rebellious not merely to reasonable authority,but to common senseand sound instinct itself. The people are everywhere deserting profitable labour. Preparation for next year i11 indefinitely suspended. The few cultivators worthy of beirig calkd farmers say, with what truth we know not, that thev can scarcely get hands at any price: Men employed at good pay-good English pay-on rail­roads, and even on iron-works, are de­serting. They are corning even from Scotland, and the north of Ireland. The cry is gone forth that they are to be employed at "" public works,"" which said "" public works "" are to be brought as near to their qwn homes as mn,y suit their convenience. The golden vision of 500 men employed on as many yards of useless road, under the rnperintendence of one little clerk armed with a note-book and a pen, and making their own engagements, possesses overpowering charms to the Celtic imagination. As for the farmP-rs, such as there are who are worthy of the name, it must be confessed that they are in a dilemma., even if they wish to do right. In, one point we suspect that there is no great disagreement between them and the labourers. They are not desirous to spend much in regular wages for profitable labour. rhey seemed disposed to adjourn all operations, particularly the operation of paying rent, sine die. They who wish to be honest are sellmg their corn. It is, however, too evident that there is a tendency to hold it on speculation. It is expected, with a degre3 of modesty ah.i1ost peculiar to Ireland, that Govern­ment is to bring the produce of all the world.to every cottage door in the island, buying at a famine price, and c,,lling at a charity price, while the stacks of grain in the country are to remain untoached. The stores of the world are to be first exhausted in feeding the Irish peasant, and then his next door neighbour is to command his own prices in the market. So prone is the Irish genius to Ruch unreasonable expectations, so little is it to be trusted for a just sense of social proprieties, that we fear the effect upon it of even a prudent alarm as to the pro­bable range of prices.. A hint of what may be possibly got for corn next summer is enough, it seems, to stir up the cupidity of the Hibernian corn dealer, of whatever class, not merely to the most extriwa.gant expectations, but to the mollt unrea.sot:1able demands. An English farmer may have his own opinion as to the next summer's prices, but he does not act upon it, for the simple reason that he has his rent to pay, and must pay it. So, in the face of his own prognostications, he sells the fruit of his labours at half its future value. While the tenantry of England, and of the greater part of the world, is under this iron yoke, the Irish tenants are claiming exemption. They ask for a little elbow room in the general squeeze, that they rna.y convert it to their own advnntage. ""!Ve are a,ware that the former does not always find it safe to transmit his produce: to the port or the market. It is, however, a matter for inquiry what proportion such outrages as the stoppage and plunder of corn and flour bears to the cases where a transit has been, or might be, safely attempted. Are there no small holders of corn at the bottom of theso tumults 1 The ,difticulty of transit is a capita.I excuse for those who do not wish to sell their crop'or pay their rent. We hear on all sides that there is a great tendency to speculation, and that among very smaIJ capitalists. They fancy they can get more by holding their corn than by sowing it. A singular correspondence between a commissariat officer and a proprietor throws some light upon this state of things, as far as concerns one of the most destitute districts,-the celebrated region of Connernara. The officer writes to offer the services of Government, in aid of any local exertions. He makes what we in this country would consider some sensible moves. He finds himself checkmated by the invincible helplessness of the sufferer. The first question is whether any relief committees have beon formed, or what steps have been ta.ken thereto. The answer is, that one has very lately been named for two half-parishes, but that the Vice-Lieutenant has not yet constituted it. So, in fact, through a complication of delays, nothing has been done. The officer then suggests a local subscription for the purchase and sale of meal, and offers a Government contribution in aid. The answer is, that nothing to speak of can be coUected on the spot. The landlords have received no rents, and cannot subscribe. The tenants have paid no rents, and will not subscribe. Whatever is done must be done. by Government. The officer :mentions the impression of Government that there still are oats and barley in the country, and that it is desirable to convert thorn into food. As mills are wanted, he ,offers to supply any number of hand-mills at £5 a-piece. The reply is, that "" the corn that may be in the country is fast rising up."" This smacks of the specula­.tion we have mentioned above. Oorn­an, unusually good yield of cc,rn of all kinds-is rising, so there is to be nefther :rent, nor wages, nor subscriptions, nor corn-mills, nor anything, in fact, except a Government importation, and a conse­quent exhaustion of all other stocks. But this very hopeful gentleman proceeds to assert that the barley and oats in the country will be wanted for seed-an excuse :too transparent to conceal .the real reason. As for the £5 hand-inills, they are, he 11ays, too dear even for the funds of a relief committee ; and .he rather sneer­ingly suggests that the best use Govern­ment can put them to is to grind for immediate use the here' and rye it has been importing for seed. .All that he can suggest in rf'turn for the advice and benevolence of the commissariat is, that it should establish a cheap shop at his own village. While this melancholy work is going on in a distri0t of Conne­mara, it is repeated on a larger scale between the PRIME MINISTER and Ire­land's only Duke. The Royal Agricul­tural SoC'iety of Ireland, of which the Duke of LEINSTER.is the head, have been sending a deputation, asking that the baronies should l1ave power to undertake . works of a useful and profitable character. Lord JOHN RussELL has met thatdemand. The baronies now have that power. His Lordship, however, avails himself of the opening afforded by that demand to address to the President of the associa­tion a letter full of suggestions so good that one's only regret is to think how little they are likely to be acted upon. The key-note of the letter is, "" Why come to us ? Do all this for yourselves/' with a gentleness of reproach-not too gentle, we hope, for its object, the noble writer says, "" Drain and improve on your own account-purchase grain yourselves---'­sell it cheap yourselves if necessary­secure the food in the country-look to future years-take a lesson from the present-do not a1ways hang upon us­teach your people iudependence.'' If the words are mild, never was advice enforced by a.. graver occasion or more terrible apprehensions. What the Duke of LEINSTER and the landlords are to do we will ourselves hardly venture to advise. We believe that they declare themselves ruined. They have subrnitte<l to presentments vastly beyond the powers of repayment, simplv to save their lives ; partly, also, in the hope that the debt, after all, will not be exacted. Let them not lay that flattering unction to their souls. '.!'he tax-payers in this empire are too old to subsidize Irish landowners. If the land must chan_ge hands, the result will be accepted with great tranquillity. The people of England will not apply to others a harder rule than they obey themselves. First or last, in one way or another, they feed and maintain their own poor ; anc\ they will deem it no small mitigation of the present calamity that it compels the application of the rule to Ireland. It is almost impossible to treat on any Irish subject without the risk of stinging national pride or exciting national pique. Whatever is hinted in the way of sugges­tion, however kindly;, or reproof, however moderate, is perverted :by our neighbours into an unmerited taunt or an: .intolerable",RELIANCE ON STATE HELP,2,11/2/1846
"NEGLECT OF AVAILABLE FOOD SUPPLIES. (LEADING_ ARTICLE, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1846.) D insult. And now that the horrors of an extraordinary calamity have supervened 01~ the ordinary evils which oppress the sister islaud, the slightest accent of advice is repelled as an insolent dicta­tion, and the smallest word of remon­strance is denounced as cruel, insulting; and inliuman. As if there were not enough already to employ men's atten­tion and monopolize their energies, the opinions of English writers are seized on with a reckless avidity,tokindle the flames of international discord and foment the fu.ry orpolitical strife. It becomes, therefore, a difficult matter for a journalist to comment upon any events which relate to Ireland without exposing himself to misconstruction and abuse. If he speak of Celtic irriprovi ., 'deuce, he is reproached for speaking lightly of the dispensations of Heaven. If he recommend. particular mode.~.9£ saving provisions or employing labour, a yell is raised,ag-,tinst him for giving a stone to a people clamorous for bread. This is in public meetings and political. gatherings. 13ut we trust that. there-are men: of in­fluence in Ireland with clear judgments and unprejudiced minds,. who recognize a duty higher than that of pandering to tbe passions of a mob, and who would welcome, from whatever quarte,r it came, any feasible suggestion for providing a practical relief of the present distress. We bave at different times copied from .provincial papers accounts of. a partial ,escape of the potatoes from the prevailing :blight. In some counties it would seem ,that n,arly half were not affected by it. But it nowhere appears that any measures liave been taken to turn .this blessing to its full account. No one among the .peMantry appears to have thougb't it worth while to make an attempt at saving that which had been so long un­scathed. And no one among the gentry seems to have impressed upon the minds ofhis dependents the duty of doing all in their power to secure for the emergencies of the coming year that which PROVI­DENCE had spared from the too wid6­.spread infection. of this. The same bar­baric thou1,thtlessness which congregates hundreds together in the hope of getting food without money, or wages without work, makes them treat with contempt all recommendations of. _patient industry and painstaking precaution. Another instance of want of foresight or want of energy has lately been exhi­bited in regard to the !>resent state-of the Irish fisheries. The provincial jour­nals have on several occasiomr within the last few weeks mentioned that the-re has been an unusual quantity of pilchards and herrings on. the southern coast this year; As-is generally the-case-when there is an abuudance of fish off Ireland, the onLy persons whoi profit by it are the fishermen from the English coast. With a new kind of food brought, as it were, providentially within their reach, the Irish people siill reject the means of staving off famine. A cry is sent forth from one end of the country to the other; that men and women are perishing of want ; yet not ari effort is made, not an arm is extended, to seize, not a mere article of necessary food, but that which compared with their common _sustenance would be a luxury,-even :w:hen it is brought almost to their doors ! It is of no use to say that an unforeseen evil has paralyi:ed all exertion and subdued all energy. A season like the present only -illustrates more strongly -the ten, dencies of national habits; and the mis­fortune of their long ir,dulgence. It is not the affliction of this year that has repressed the native 13nterprise of .the Irish people or tamed their usual.ardour; but it is their orcHnary listlessness, H is their innate wapt of enterprise, their indifference to present comfort and-future wants, that has made the sufferings of this year more intense than they need be. This year only presents to view an extreme instance of that which has happened in other years. The traveller will often be astonished by that which so forcibly .struck our own Commisiri.oner-.­viz., the neglect with which the Irish treat that which might be made a perpetual source of competence, if not of wealth, to them. The sea round the southern coasts teems with fish. In Scull-bay and Crook haventhey are so plentiful thatthe l?easants often knock them on their heads with oars, yet will not take the trouble of netting them. They rather starve in the midst of the national wealth, which they: leave to be gleaned bythe bolder efforts of the Cornish or Devonshire adventurer. They sit in their squalid huts content to season their scant potato diet with a solitary herring, and beg of their neighbours, or strangers, or Government-as the case may be-the remnant of their wretched fare. Let it not be said that we are taunting misery or upbraiding famine. We are pointing out a malady in the national character which has pniceded and induced a more fearful malady in the physical condition of the people. The want of food this year results in some l degree from want of enterprise in vast l years. Had the Irish peasantry been en­. couraged to :malie use of the national 1 advantages which their country pos­sesses, they would not now be ,bickering i against task-work, or plundering provi­ sion stores. Had they exhibited the same prudent energy in clubbing together to man fishing-boats that they do on the spur of an English harvesting, they would not have seen a valuable trade pass into ""n.lien hands,"" or have found themselves so helpless in a great social crisis. Let no man think that we intend to lay the whole blame on th!cl untaught Celtic peasant and his hereditary character. Character is always modified by circum­stances and moulded by instruction. Heaven knows that he has been dis­ciplined in .a hard school. His circum­stances have ever been rugged ; his in­structors inept or perverse. They have taught him in tums everything but that :wl1ich was most necessary for him to know. They have fostered every pas.sion which they ought to have quelled, and f9rgo.tten every lesson w.hich they ought 'to have inculcated. They have made l1im a partisan of clans, families, factions, and creeds, not of cleanliness, prudence, or per­severing industry. He has learned to hate whom his LIBERATOR reviles, and curse whom his p:;:iest denounces. He votes with his landlord and against him­blesses or execrates him-according to the dictation of the Altar or the Corn Ex­change. Three-and only three-human objects fill the void of his mind-his land- lord, hisLIBERA.TOR,and his priest. But not one of these has ever deigned to tell him the familiar lesson known to every villag8 hind in England-that unless he works he cannot save, and that if he does not save he must starve. He struggles on from one year . to another of contented wretchedness ; then comes a year of evil and great suffering, and,lo ! the state to: which the idols of his mind have reduced him!",NEGLECT OF AVAILABLE FOOD SUPPLIES,2,11/5/1846

What increases the province of Connaught are respectively m,arvel is; that their prosperity; in £9,600, and £4,400 ; so that the ptov:ince different districts, appears to be exactly had £5,200 more in the savings-banks, it D2 is to be presumed, on October 10, 1846, .'than on the corresponding day the previous year, though in the interval there were two famines, two great measures of relief, two general sinkings or risings, prostrations or insurrections, whatever they are to be called, of the p3asantry. This at least is singular. VVe have heard of. bankruptcies being very profitable affairs. A man twice bankrupt, it is said, ought to be rich. This does for individuals. But for a whole population commend us to a famine. A few more famines, and Ireland will become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The population of Connaught bids fair to thrive wonder­fully on rotten potatoes we_ll sauced with ""relief"" works. There is the true remedy for this mysterious disease, . which the English savari,s were so long looking for, and with so little success. The receipt is as follows :-Empty a .. cart-load of the infected potatoes on one side of the road, and set 50 men to shovel the heap to the other side, giving them ls. each for the day's work, and you will find that the men will not only subsist on the potatoes, but will put by. The receipt answers admirably in Connaught. Thus Mayo, which a whole tribe of lvI'HALES are always declaring to be at the point of starvation, -drew out only £2,300, and paid in as much at £3,200. Roscommon paid in £3,300, and drew out nothing. Sligo paid .in £1,800, and also drew out nothing. . Munster exhibits equally wonderful r.esults. The whole province paid in £80,699, and drew out only £53,800, thus improving its account to the handsome extent of £26,899. We have frequently heard economists pronounce the potato rot the making of Ireland, but we think they could hardly have anticipated such immediata results. The particular in­ atances are some of them exceedingly striking. Clare one always hears of very .early in the famine. It occupi'?s an equally prominent position in this return. The Ennis trustees ""paid in"" £7,100, and drew out £300, tbe difference in the favour of the Clare contributors being no less than £6,800. Kerry seems to have done very well considering. The trustees at Killarney had paid in £7,300 and dmwn out £3,100-not nearly half. Tralee has not been equally fortunate, or equally ingenious. It has pai<l in £4,800, and drawn ont, £2,700, which is rather more than half. Limerick beats them all. It3 ~rustees have paid in £18,200, only draw­mg out £3,300, The exceptions are generally insigni ficant. The only one of any importance is that which occurs in Dublin itself, and has nothing to do with either the potato rot or the relief measures. As much as £223,800 was drawn out by St. Peter's parish, Dublin, between October 25, 1845, and ,January 3, 1846, in consequence of a rumour that the funds of that bank were not sufficient to meet the demands of the depositors. Such is the explanation given in the return. The circumstance that .this happened to be exactly the period of the panic in the railway market may possibly have something to do with it. So large a sum of course gives an un­favourable result as far as the whole of Ireland is concerned ; but taking Con~ naught and Munster separately, the excess of the deposits over the sums with­ drawn is £32,099. We repeat that it is most gratifying to be able thus to sound the depth of Irish dhtress. .A savings-bank, to be sure, is not the best form of savi~ ;it is too much like hoarding for us. J! ar more satis­factory is it to see capital wedded to industry, invested in stock, intrusted to the grateful soil, and returning a better interest to its owners than 3¼ per cent. We must say it is something like burying a talent in a napkin to lend £100 to so indifferent a banker. That, however, just now is a minor consideration. If the Irish peasantry have not such large heaps of potatoes as usual, it is dear they have better deposits. Somehow or other they have managed to make up the defi­ciency. One thing, however, we have~ right to ask, and that fa, that when the pecuniary result of the two famines has been thus far so decidedly favourable to the Irish, they should give the British Government some credit for supplying thfl deficiencies and mitigating the visitations of Nature. It is plain by the infallible rules of COCKER that the partial destruction of one potato crop, and the almost entire destruction of the other, ought to have left the population generally very much poorer. The actual result, however, is far otherwise. Something has qualified the inflictions of PROVIDENCE and the deduc­tions of arithmetic. The compensation has happily prevailed over the calamity. It is proved, iri pounds, shillings, and pence, that the Legislature possesses a claim to Irish gratitude. That the claim will be acknowledged, even in the face of this return, we dare' hardly expect.",THE IRISH SAVINGS B.ANKS,2,11/5/1846
"WASTE LANDS IN IRELAND. . (LETTER TO THE EDITOR, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1846.) Sir,-Would you allow through your columns a few brief observations on re­claiming waste lands in Ireland ? I beg to premise that Irish waste lands, generally speaking, mean bogs or peat soils, and that these substances in Ireland possess a peculiarly antiseptic quality, and to such a.high degree as not alone to preserve matter from decay, but to confer a power to resist decay. Fertile la ids have wholly different agencies. Reclaimed Irish wastes have ever a tendency to fall back into their original state, and exertions must be constantly applied to overcome their strong natural inclination to sterility. Huwe we see any successful instances of redeemed land almost invariably confined to cattier gar­dens, bogskirts, and patchrn annexed to old lands, all continuousfy turned up, manured, &c. The crops on "" reclaimed "" wastes in Ireland are more subject to failure or blight than crops on the old lands. I have seen crops entirely blasted in one night on the former grounds, whilst the same crops,' on the old land 1t!ongside, growing from the same seed, sown at the same time, and cultivated in the same manner, remained untouched and unharmed. The expense of reclaiming Irish wastes ex­ceeds the market price of the fee of the best old lands. Look at the price paid to reclaim Trafford-moss or Chat-moss, and these w~re concerns very different in qualities from a ""rale'' genuine Irish bog. lt would be desirable if the advocates for reclaiming would point out a single example of a reclaimed Irish waste where the expenditure diu riot exceed the purchase-money of an equal extent of good old enclosed land, and where tenden­cies to deterioration havo not appeared. But suppos<ci for the instant that re­claimed wastes were profitable and safe investments, I ask would the Irish people 0 on such territory be better oft than the Irish people on the old territory 7 Where is the hope ? Is character to be changed 1 Are social institutions to be amended ? Or are we to supposa that Misery will lose her sting from having new regions to develop her qualities ? It is supposed that a proprietary culti­ vator class would arise on reclaimed lands, and present to us, through men labouring for themselves, blooming fields and happy homes. There is a something more wanted to attain these ends than the condition of every man working"" for himself and on his own grounds. The grounds must have the capability of re paying the labour expended on them, C Irish wastes have not this capability. Instead of blooming fields, crested by the Penates and Lares, and all the household gods, we might behold blighted fields and cheerle:;s, crownless hearths. In place of ""Shepherds nightly nodding o'er their flocks,"" we might have fiery Celts and their shivering wives and families huddled together on rushes or fern, The difficulty is gigantic, from having a population stimulated and left depen­dent on an unsafe and acclimated plant ; are we to add to all our perplexities by "" home colonization"" on unsafe lands f The Irish people were given a :peculiar foreign vegetable for food, subject to total blast and destruction ; are vm now to place them on a territory on which all food crops, without distinction, are li1tble to failure and annihilation ? We must turn our attention to the old enclosed lands for security and employ­:rnent. I refer to the evidence published some years since by order of Parliament, relating to this matter, and particularly to that of the officer of V.' oods and Forests sent to Ireland. He empha,tically deposed that we should look solely to the old enclosed lands to obtain the pros­perity of Ireland. Mighty intereds are at stake. We cannot tamper, ar.d dare not try experiments. If 1reland is to support the Irish people, it is clear the action must be on her employers and food producers. To this end let us forthwith ascertain the liabilities of support in each parish. The English people are deeply concerned in this, and every consideration urges on them to press the Legislature to provide that the poor in each parish in Ireland shall be set to work under the poor law of Elizabeth.

Sir,-! take the liberty of enclosing you the proceedings of the relief sessions _of the Barony of Coshma, in the county 'of Limerick, held on the 17th inst., and trust you will give publicity to them.

Many of the ;proprietors in this country are able ,'and willing to take upon themselves ,the entire labour attached to their pro­fllerties, and last year did not accept ;of public funds for their support. Is it !likely that this could continue now that,lby law, the late Act of Parliament charges )them in addition with a proportion of fthe neglected labour on all the other flands in tho district ? The consequence /is quite obvious ; and the complaint you!have so frequently made of the labourers ;being dismimed must follow, as no man can take his own proportion on himself, ,~and the Government fund is called on lfor the employment of the entire mass. /I venture to say, if the townland :system were adopted, as recommended by ;the Agricultural Association of Ireland, :-or even if proprietors were per­':mitted to relieve themselves from all rother responsibility, by employing the tlabour on their lands, at tbeir own -expense-that a very large reduction -would soon appear in the number of those who are now employed by the Government, and one path, at least, left open for restoring labour to its natural channel. I have the honour to remain, Sir, Your obedient servant, A COUNTY OF LIMERICK I'ROPRIETOR. Croom, Ireland, Nov. 19. At an Extraordinary Presentment Sessions Meeting of the Magistrates and Cesspayers of the Barony of Coshma, held under the proclamation of the Lord­Lieutenant at Croom, on Tuesday, the 17th inst., the Earl of Dunraven in the chair, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted :­ "" Resolved, that while we willingly tax ourselves for the support of the poor in this seasrm of dearth and misery, we deprecate in the strongest terms the laws that force us to waste the property and labour of the country in works which are useless, and in many instances in­jurious, and which under no other circum­stances would be either proposed or tolerated. "" That, with every anxiety to carry out the principle contained in Mr. Labouchere's letter, by presenting for works of a reproductive nature, we find it impossible to do so from the conditions with which it is clogged, the Croom electoral district alone of the barony con­taining 48 townlands, and the other three districts nearly the same propor­tion, rendering it quite impossible to combine them or obtain the acquiescence of the several proprietors, many of whom are absentees resident abroad, not even represented here. "" That, unless some simple method be devised, by which each townland may be enabled to apply the amount of labour for which it is to be taxed to works of utility, the present ruinous system must continue, which cannot fail to prove fatal to all classes in the country, by con­fiscating the property of the gentry, and laying the foundation of future destitu­tion for the peasantry, withdrawing their labour from the cultivation and improve­ment of the soil. "" That we are willing to charge our­selves with the destitute labour on our estates, to find for such labour full em­ployment, at fair wages, provided the destitution upon neighbouring properties shall not be chargeable on our lands. All we require is an amendment of the laws obliging each townland to provide for its own labourers, as far as 50 per cent. of its value, after which, we submit, that the remaining distress on such townlands should be met by some general arrange­ment of Government. "" That in our opinion if these prin­ciples were carried out by just and equal legislation, forcing all proprietors or their tenants to take charge of the population on their respective estates, or that if neglected, a moiety of such estates should be confiscated to the poor thereon, under such laws exertions would follow pro­ductive of general benefit, by giving an individual interest which would cause a rapid advancement of agricultural and manufacturing industry, productive of great profit to the industrious proprietor, and of certain employment to th"" labour­ing classes of this country. '' That if this stimulant be not given, and that the mass of destitute labourers (now over 2,000 persons, em­ployed in this barony at the public ex­pense) continue to be thrown into one common stock, chargeable on the barony at large, it muet end in the total confisca­tion of the estates, leaving the country a waste, and throwing the labouring popula­tion entirely on the Government for sup port. "" That the maintenance of the vast multitude of 2,000 labourers and their families, chargeable on so small adistrict has made tho fear of confircation invade every man's mind, and paralyzes the in­dividual exertions of all persons who con­sider the likelihood of losing all benefit from their industry, by the general and indiscriminate charge on their properties of the surplus labour of the country.

"LANDLORDS AND THE POOR LAW. (LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1846.) . The proceedings of the Extraordinary Baronial Sessions at Croom are con­sidered by tho "" County of Limerick Pro­prietor,"" who has recommended them to our notice, entirely conclusive as to the good intentions of his class, and the clumsy and ruinous character of the recent Ministerial measures, We are aware that it is thought exceedingly impertinent to dofend a Governme:::it, or a Legislature, or anything else in the world, when a body of Irish landowners is concerned. Even if it is obvious on the simplest re­flection that wo are speaking the language and advocating the institutions which we have belcn taught to venerate from child­hood itself, it is assumed tlmt our argu­ment is nothing more; than a mischievous weapon seized on the spur of the moment for the purpose of discharging it :,,t the devoted head of the Irish landlord. It is as Englishmen that we write. vVe desire to propagate the laws we enjoy er have enjoyed to our gain. vVo really cannot oblige our friends across the Channel by forgetting that system of public charity in the heart of which we had the happi­ness to bo born, and to which we partly trace the immeasurable difference between the condition of the Irish peasant and tho English labcu~ er. We are habituated to it. All our ideas of relief are cast in that ancient mould. 'When, therefore we are invited to give our advice and our money to relieve the distresses of Ireland, uncivil and obtrusive as some may think it, we cannot help lamenting the absence of our own Poor Laws, such as they have been till lately, and such as Ireland at least requires ; nor can ,\ e help deprecating the obstinate ingenuity with which tl,e Irish landowners continue even now to reject them. 'fhe resident gentry of the barony of Coshma have made the notable discovery that both the original measut e oi' the .Poor Employment Act and the ex tended previsions set forth in Mr. LAnoucnEnE's letter are liable to very serious objections. The former taxes all the proprietors very heavily, aul quite indiscr-iminately, for public works gene­rally of little value, sometimes positively injurious, and always tending to demora­lize the peasantry by withdrawing them from agriculture, arid encouraging the taste for combination. The latter is tedious and difii.cult of application, by re­quiring many consents, by such cautious provisces. Nothing can be more philo­sophical than the tone of the resolutions' at Croom on this subject. But th0re are people who ahvays talk wisely. They never say a foolish thing. Unfortunately1 tl!ey seem to suffer what may be de­scribed in medical language as a determi­nation of wisdom to thp tongue, "" For Heaven's sake, don't talk so wisely,"" we are ready to exclaim, "" b11t just give your fingers a turn. Act as wisely as you talk."" To what purpose is it to prove that imprompfa measures are charac­terized by a waste of power and a clumsi­ness of application ? When you close your shutters because your windows are broken by a hailstorm, do you expect to have light as well as shelter 1 When the crew of a foundering vessel commits itself to a raft, does it expect dry berths and ten knots an hour ? When your horses upset your carriage in a storm, leaving you to get over five miles of muddy lane as best you can, in what condition do you expect to arrive at your j mrney's encl ? Of course, extraordinary measures always are imperfect. :Makeshifts always are bad. It is a fitting retribution to impro­vidence that they should be so. There must be loss of power and everything else in continual alterations and correc­tions of policy. The resident gentry in the barony of Coshma are only telling the LoRn-LrnuTENANT and Lord JoHN Rus­SELL what they know too well already. From the inherent vices of everv extra­ordinary measure attempted for 1rehmd the only real escape is a permanent system such as that which has worked so well in this country for nearly three hundred years. However, the law-cob­blers of the county of Limerick learn no such salutary lesson. They wish to go on pll,tching, still, it is amusing to ob­serve, with only a temporary objcr.t. The very first words of the first resolution betray the pious horror with which they recoil from a permanent system. "" Re­solved-That while we willingly tax our­selves for the support of the poor in this season of dearth and misery, &c."" So whatever is to be done is only for the present moment. Let us have no precedent pf an effectual Poor Law. These gentle­men seem to have a very periodical idea of human affairs. Are the Irish peasantry in want only once in.ten years ? Do they, like the boa constrictor, take only a dozen meals in a lifetime, after a dozen proper intervals spent in torpor and abstinence 1 \Ve are at a loss to see what permanent good a derennial measure of relief will do towards raising the condition and charac­ter of the people. 'fherv is another consideration which Englishmen, as constituting the vast majority of the tax-payers,may be allowed to appreciate. The expense of a regular system of public relief may be defrayed, as the English Poor Law is, out of the annual income of Ireland. An extra­ordinary measure, on the contrary, in­volves a heavy loan,-besides the expense of the machinery, besides al ~o large bene­factions,-from the Imperial 'l'reasury. This loan must also come at a time when it is most inconvenient. It is equivalent to that of an expensive war, or the sup­pression of an extensive rebellion. Do these gentlemen then seriously propose that England shall purchase for them an unmerited, unfair, improper, and impoli­tic ex€mption from an ordinary and uni­versal duty, at the cost of cntniling upon itself a periodical inconvenience of 110 trifling character Y In England we are perfectly aware that a temporary measure must be indiscrimi­nate, and we accordingly feel a wise horror of makeshifts. We may admire a feat of inglnuity once or twice, and derive sorne amusement from even a morn frequent repetition. But the man who appears to haye no plan but that which is suggested by the crisis, and who rows J1is skiff so clumsily that one hand is always employed in corr.ecting the excesses of the other, soon loses caste in English esti­mation. We know that nothing done in a hurry is done well. '!'he affairs of domestic government are not to be de­spatched with the expedition of a pitched battle. If we choose to be wLe and humane only once in ten years, it must be in rather a bungling fasl1ion. Our ad­visers 'at Croom, however, .,xpect the care, the experience, the information of a century to be condensed into a day. They modestly ask that Government shall deal with every particular township in Ire-­land. Will they reckon up how many townships there are Y Think of that for a temporary measure ! Think of that for a three months' or a six weeks' process. Think of an extraordinary s2ssion, a pre­sentment, a plan, an estimate, a visit by a Government surveyor, a loan, fifty letters backwards and forwards, a ten years' repayment, besides all the other etceteras of Irish business, multiplied by the number of townships ! It would take at least a hundred Boards of Works to do the most moderate justice to the gigantic operation, and at least a hundred mem­bers of Parliament to defend their pro­ceedings from the attacks ,vhich every separate township would be sure to semi up the next session. A regnlar, universal, and permanent system of public relid can be discriminate, and can deal with individuals and minute locH,)ities ; a tem­porary measure cannot. It must sow money, employment, and burdens too, broadcast over the island. There is no -help for it. As a nameless voice called out from the crowd at the Croom sessions, the proprietors "" have brought it all on themselves !"" There is a very natural degree of vacila­tion in the ideas of the meeting at Croom, resulting, of course,in the circum­stance that there were more hands at work on the resolutions than could be quite reconciled in the preparatory hour and a half. In one and the same resolu­tion we find the expression of a wi!Jing­uess to take the whole charge of the destitute poor on the several estates, and a rather unintelligible, hnlf-and-half pro­position, whbh shows off that willingness to very little advantage. However, let us deal with the willingness,without that disagreeable qualification. '.l'he landowners there met are willing to find their poor full productive employ­ment this year, on. the condition of re­funding the loan in ten years. They expect, or at least all the rest of the world ex­pects, that by the end of ten years there will be such another crisis, besides some minor affairs in the interval. All is then to be repeated. Now, we humbly sub­mit that a loan made every ten years, and repaid by annual instalments spread over the intervals, is equivalent to an annual burden for ever. Why should not the landlords then ask for a, good Poor Law at once, seeing that it is exactly the same thing in the end, as far as their pockets are concerned, and a thousandfold more easy, discriminating, and reproduc­tive. ­",LANDLORDS AND THE POOR LAW,2,11/25/1846
"LANDLORDS’ OBJECTIONS TO A POOR LAW. (FRID.AY, DECEMBER 18, 1846.) TO RIGHT HON. LORD JOHN. RUSSELL. The memorial of the undersi~ned showeth,-That your memorialist 1s a resident landlord in the county of----, on the ,vest coast of Ireland, where he has resided for above 25 years. That he has during the whole of that time ex­pended every year the whole amount of his rental in the employment of the people, and endeavoured to improve their condition, his property being very populous , though of moderate value. That he has so far succeeded in his endeavours, tbat no person from his pro­perty has ever been an inmate of a poor­house, nor does his estate supply any pauper labourers for the public works now in progress, unless they be discharged from his employment for the causes here­inafter mentioned. That in consequence of the failure of the potato crop, upon which the people chiefly i;ubsisted, memo­rialist is, with all other landlords in this quarter, deprived of the usual income from his estate, while bis tenants abso­lutely require extensive aid to enable them to subsist. That although he has not the means of supplying the wants of his tenantry and of the labouring poor upon his property, he has taken measures for charging his estate with a loan, to be laid out in such works as shall increase its value, while it affords susten,nee to its occu_piers. That he is satisfied that, with the means and facilities afforded, and likely to be afforded, he (and all landlords similarly circumsta1iced) can very well support his own poor, if with a good deal of present self-denial, yet with­out ultimate loss to himself, or injury to his property, unless prevented by the operation of unfair laws. That the opera­tion of the laws at present in force for the maintenance of destitute paupers in poor­houses, and for their employment upon public works for the purpose of sustaining them, is such as to prevent or overfhrow every such endeavour as that of memo­rialist to keep his tenantry from sinking into poverty, and the poor upon his pro­perty from destitution. For the law makes the divisions, or districts, which are equally taxed for poor-rates, without reference to the boundaries of properties, so that while memorialist has by years of expenditure and exertion raised his tenantry above pauperism, and while he is by the greatest self-denial procuring means to keep the whole population upon his property from destitution, he is taxed enormously for the maintenance of those paupers created by the neglect of others, and now is liable to an assessment of un­known amount to provide for the employ­ ment of the impoverished population of other estates. That memorialist has already voluntarily sunk 20 years' income, and more, in improving and sustaining bis property and tenan.try, and is ready to continuetodo so,ifthelaw does not continue to threaten him with utter ruin in return for his doing so. That the neighbouring properties, almost without exception, abound with destitute or very impove­r.ished persons, who fill the poor house, and crowd to the public works opened for their employment, though all of these pro­perties are equally well circumstanced, or f!hould be so, as that of memorialist ; and that he will be obliged to bear such a 13hare of the cost of supporting these pau­pers as will be al:solutely ruinous as well as flagrantly unjust, unless the law be altered so as to compel each property to .support or employ its own poor. That, besides the dreadful taxation, memofrilist is much impoverished by the numerous calls for private charity and private sub­scription, to keep the above-mentioned destitut,i and neglected persons from absolute starvation before his eyes, while their natural protectors stay away, or shut their eyes, or satisfy their conscience with the subscription of a pittance utterly unequal to their duty and inadequate to the wants of tlleir poor. That memo­rialist would, thereforo, respectfully and urgently suggest and press upon your .Lordship the consideration of his case, and the demand made by common right and justice that the law should be at once altered, so as to lay the burden in the right place, and to encourage and insure the employment of the poor population in 'useful works, and in a way so much more conducive to the national welfare and character than that of working in pauper gangs, congregated upon public works, which is found so perplexing and expen­sive to the Government, as well as demo­,ralizing to the people. That this would be easily attained by making all assess­ ments for pauper support or employment to be levied upon the divisions called ""townlands,"" such being almost always the property of one owner (making ex­ceptions where any peculiar circum­stances require it, as in the case of the paupers of towns). That although land­lords are the most obviously called on to support paupers, or prevent pauperism, yet all classes are, according to their wealth, justly to be charged with a portion of the cost of this, especially land-occupiers, mill-owners, merchants, shopkeepers, &c., all of whom have more or less benefited by the work and in­dustry of the pauper while able to labour, That, therefore, while the maintenance of the pauper should be charged on the land, and divided in just proportion between tho occupiers and tho owner of each townland, the expense of building, and maintaining,and furnishing the poor­house,and keeping up its permanent staff, shoula be at the general public exi:;ense. Memorialist has prepared a petition to this effect to Her Majesty, which has been signed by the members for this county,by a irreat number of the nobility, and gentry,-and tenantry, and will be forwarded for presentation in a few days, a copy wl1ereofaccompanies this memorial, and to the prayer of which your Lord­ship's attention is requested. Memo­rialist considers that in laying his case before your Lordship, the l irst Minister of the Crown, he lays the case of Irish landlords, both resident and absentee, as also of the poor npon their estates, who are the chief sufferers in the matter, before the public of the empire, and espe­cially before the Houses of Parliament, before which he would respectfully en­treat your Lordship to bring this matter, in order to procure a just legis lation on the subject. Memorialist remains your Lordship's humble servant,",LANDLORDS’ OBJECTIONS TO A POOR LAW.,2,12/18/1846
"AN ULSTER LANDLORD, (LEADING .AETICLE, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1846.) The Memorial of"".An Ulster Landlord"" insists on a plea which in this country:will always be a.ttencled to. He asks for 1'air play, and establishes, if not a griev­fance, at least an inequality. He has re­~ided for a quarter of a century,and spent:l\ll his rental in the employment and im­>provement of a people on a populous estate. The gratifying and honourable .result is, that not one of them has ever been an inmate of a poorhouse, and, what is still more remarkable, not one of them is at present upon the "" public works."" Having thus clone his best, ho considers that he deserves an immunity from the rumous taxation, not to call it by a still stron~er term, which the negligence, penuriousness, and inhumanity of other landlords have brought on the country, He claims to be excepted both from the present baronial assessment, and also. from the impending poor-rate, if the latter is to be assessed on the same broad and indiscriminate principles. At least he asks that, with certain exceptions, properties, not parishes, shall be the areas of assessments. There is something besides fair play in the claim, as the "" Ulster Landlord "" does not omit to show. He can at present just do a land­lord's duty with his own. With that ad­ditional burden, that ,ca,cov hran6v, a d1s­trict rate, he will be obliged to reserve for the collector what he now gives to his stewarq, and throw away upon useless paupers what now finds profitable em­ploym(mt for the independent labourer, .This is his case, and the case of many other lancllords. If we have not done it full justice, a perusal of the document will detect the deficiency. But, when we come to grei,t social and political. questions, we may well ask, What is fair play 1 Is it possible to make an exact computation of individual deserts, , or to devise any measures that shall exempt providence and humanity fr_om the burdens entailed by thAir oppo.­s~tes 1 Can this be done, either at a moment's warning or with the prepara­tion of a century 1 Social fair play is not a':debtor and creditor account which can be thus easily balanced. Society is full of the grossest inequalities, We might safely challenge our worthy, though indignant, memorialist,to point out a single practical instance of the Utopian proportion between merit and reward whicl1 he re­quires. But, not to be unnecessarily dis­cursive, we will confine ourselves to the case of the landlord. The ""Ulster Landlord"" cannot charge us with any wilful unfairness if we mete to him the same measure that we do to ourselves. In fact,. we only rllcommend for Ireland the old English Poor Law, as far as it can be applied to the country. We can see no unfairness either in the Irish Poor Employment Act, or in the more permanent enactment of which the ""Ulster Landlord"" very naturally deems it the precursor, which English landlords have now long suffered as a matter of necessity. .As for the measure now in operation, there is no use talking about it. We admit everything that can pos­sibly be said against it. One answer meets all the objections. Itcannot be helped, It1s childish and ridiculous to complain. Four millions were to be fed at a month's warn­ing.Youmustuse a roughand ready means for such a crisis. If your child is in flames, you must not spare your fingus, much less your hearthrug. It is of no use to calculate and philosophize when moments are precious. For our own rart, we never doubted that there would be a lamentable "" aste of labour and money, and a still more lamentable demoraliza­tion of industry.. Much the same happens at every calamity. If a house is on fire, the furniture of half the street is thrown out of the windows, or saturated. with water, and some fifty firemen and helpers will be equally saturated with a more generous liquor for a week to come. But if the ""Ulster Landlord'' is to have only his own men thrown upon him, who is to undertake the miserable crowd11 that herd in the towns or squat on neglected properties 1 The burden must be shared by all who can bear it. .All England, landlord and manufacturer, high and low, rich and poor, share the burden. .At a moment of unexampled pressure the Treasury is ad­vancing some five or six millions. The price of every English labourer's daily bread is enhanced by the cahm1tous denoitement of the Irish social drama. Now, are not we all, on this side the water, less implicated in the crime than the "" Ulster Landlord 1"" He has held property for 25 years v.:ithout agood Poor Law-till recently without any at all. That of itself is a crime in our eyes. Moreover, the "" Ulster Landlord"" admit,i that his tenantry depended on the potato crop. He is, therefore, per~onally com­promised in the vicious system which has Jed to the present disaster. The memorialist assumes that the measure now in such rough and violent operation will be mended and adjusted i11to a permanent law. This we should imagine can hardly be doubted, He tllen offers his own suggestions. The principal one is,that each townland,being i;;enerally a separate property, shall maintain or employ its own JlO0r, His reaeon is ob­vious from the above. If the assessment is on a larger district, ccmprehending many townlands, without referenoo to the divisions of private property, he will find himself charged with a surrounding mass of pauperism, caused by the inhumanity or neglect of his neighbours. In fact, he will have to maintain their poor as well as his own,and considerably to the injury of his own~ What extent of district will be taken,--what will be found possible, -what expedient, we will not now venture to predict ; but if the unfairness so warmly deprecated by the memorialist should be actually perpetrated, we can only say that it is one which is very abundantly suffered in this country. So familiarized are we to the burden of our neighbour's neglect, that we have come to look upon it as a social necessity, and part of the great debt we owe to society and to Hn1 who gave us all we possess and imposed upon us all we have to do. Nothing is m:,re usual th:m for an Eng­lish landowner to employ his share, and far more than his share, of labour on his land, and sink many more than 20 yei.rs' rental on the improvement of his pro­perty, and then find himself in the very predicament from which the "" Ulster Landlord"" appeals to our sense of fair play to be delivered. Owing to th\l em­ployment be affords, it becomes an object to get into his parish from the less fortu­nate neighbourhood. The smaller pro­prietors speculate on this fact, and either run up cottages by wholesale, or sell the land at a high price to some little builder or huckster who buys it for that purpose. A colluvies of poverty and vice flows into the opening thus made, and the parish is inundated, to the augmenti\tion of its burdens and the inj .iry of its character and psace. Thus, the more employ­ment there is, the more it is demander!. In large and populous parishes, divided amongst many proprietors, no private means, no private humanity or enterprise can keep pace with the press11re of that law of necessity which is always urging poverty towards the neighbourhood of em­ployment. If we understand our memo­rialist aright, thia is what he considers he ought to be protected from. He wishes his own townland to stand alone, neither helping, nor being helped, while, if the ci:owded and poverty struck townlands about him eat nptheir rental, it is nomore than what the proprietors deserve. They will only have to make in a year or two, and by necessity, a sacrifice which he has distributed over many years, from the impulse of social duty. Applying, however, exactly the same rule to the Irish as to English landlords, we must re:ply, that the question is not one of eqmty, but of charity combined with considerations of a still more urgent nature. The people must be employed or maintained. That burden must be laid, not on those who deserve it, but on those who can bear it. If it is found that a large proportion of townlands cannot maintain their poor, even by an entire sacrifice of the rental, they must l:e mani~ pula+ed into sufficient and capable dis- tricts. This is not the time for reckoning up arrears of neglect, and holding _a great assize upon tr:e quick and the dead Irish proprietors. Things must be dealt with. as they are. That will be thi;i best for all in the end. Any very nic9 attempt to save Irish capital, or reward Irish virtue, will only deprive legislation of its effi­ciency, and entail a universal catastrophe far more serious than an unfair participa­tion in social burdens. Charity must spread its cloak over the inequalities of the system. But it is not merely the dictate of charity. Self-preservation itself enjoins a strong and, so to speak, uuscru pulous measure.",AN ULSTER LANDLORD,2,12/18/1846
"IRISH OBJECTION TO POOR LAW. (LETTER TO THE EDITOR, TUESD.AY, JANU.ARY 5, 1847.) Sir,-No doubt it bears an invidious aspect, and is a course open to obvious and shallow taunts, for any one to dis­suade, as you have, in my opinion, most rightly, dissuaded your readers from the indulgence of a blind and thoughtless charity, in contributing through a sub­scription list to the relief of the Irish poor. This has been the usual resource in all previous emergencies of the kind ; and with what result ? Why the money went to pay the rents of landlords, who them­selves refused to contribute-a farthing to save their own tenantry from starving­llay, it actually purchased in Liverpool and Bristol the corn grown by those tenants, and sent it back to feed the very men who had raised, but had been forced to sell it, to satisfy the pressing demands of their landlord or his agent ! And this is precisely what will again take place when any money is subscribed here, Ji.ven at this moment the Liverpool papers re­cord daily arrivals of oats from Ireland in that port, coming from districts where the people are starving, and sent over here on account of the landowners. It is true that \Vith the corn they send over their poor too ! But we have to pay for the former and feed the latter. The anticipated invasion of Irish pau­perism ha:; commenced. 15,000 have Rlready within the bst three months landed in Liverpool, and block up her thoroughfares with masses of misery, which by our law, must be and is relieved. And the cry is,-"" Still they come !"" How should it be otherwise 1 On thi~ side of the Channel the law insures them against starvation. On the other they are allowed to starve, and must starve un­relieved ! According to Mr. Chadwick, tl1e usual annual immigration is from 300,000 to 400,000. This year we must expect it to be doubled. And, as the recent Non-Removal Act has given a virtual settlement to all who may con­trive to remain five years here, we may make up our mind., to have the entire pauperism of Ireland before long bodily quartered upon us for a permanency, if no steps are speedily taken to secure them a maintemmce at home. But this will never be done so long as John Bull is content to support the poor of Ireland by Government grants, private sub­scriptions, and taking them on his own pauper lists ;-so long as he shows this amiable readiness to relieve the Irish landlords from the performance of that duty which nature and justice require of him, but which the law has not yet im­posed. The very root and origin of the evils from which Ireland is now suffering­fans et 01 igo mali-is that dependence on voluntary charity which we are now called on still further to encourage. Had England nut been so lavish of her benevo­lence on former occasions, the law would before now have stepped in to compel the wealthy classes of Ireland to do their duty, and the poor of that country would have been secured from perishing of want. But it is said the Government cannot do more than employ the able­bodied ; and the Relief Committee can­not collect sufficient funds in Ireland to save the infirm poor from destruction. But wh:y should not the Government lend the necessary funds for this purpose to the Relief Committees, on the security of the rates, as in the case of the money required for paying the able-bodied 1 Why, when in England we are rated some four or five millions a-year for out-door relief to our infirm poor, is there to be not a farthing raised in Ireland for the same purpose, where the necessity for it is so much greater ? The Irish landlords cry out that their estates are being con­fiscated-Rut if we are to SUDDort their infirm poor by subscriptions and grants, they may contrive to make a very good thing of the relief they are forced to give to the able-bodied. See only the brief but speaking application of Lord de Freyne to the Government. He states on the best authority that by expending £24,000, borrowed of Go­vernment, in reclaiming the waste land of his estate, he nan and will increase his rental by £3,000 a-year ! That is, he will realize 12½ per cent. per annum by the employment he will give to the able-bodied labourers on his property ! Ex imo omnes. There is probably 6carcely an estate in Ireland where the same thing cannot be done. And why has it never yet been done 1 Because nothing but the pinching pressure of necessity will urge the apathetic and careless Irish landlords . to improve their properties or employ the people on them.. And'if the charity of ];ngland now, as heretofore, interpose between them and the necessity which is now opening their eyes to the enormous resources at their disposal, which they have hitherto neglected, they will fall asleep again, and the lesson which this crisis promises to teach will still be lost on them. vYhy, too, if landlords can make 12 per cent. on their outlay in employing the able-bodied labourers now destitute, and thus largely increase their incomes instead of diminishing them, are they not to be required to pay the necessary cost of maintaining their impotent pool"" likewise, even though that should prove a tax on them ? Hitherto the Irish poor­rate has not reached sixpence in the pound on the average ; while in Liverpool the rates are swelled to 4s. by the influx of Irish paupers ! No, no ! Ireland, which annually exports some 15 millions' worth of food, is quite as capable as Eng­land, nay,more so, to maintain her entire population. Lend her the necessary funds at a moment of pressure like this, and until the fitting machinery of an effective Poor Law be establiFhed, if you will ; but if we give them, as heretofore, either by private charity, public subscription, or Government grants, we shall only per­petuate the habit she has acquired of de­pending on extraneous aid and chance contributions, neglectful of her own ample . resources, and of the just claims 11pon them of her oppressed and miserable people.

"IRISH PROPERTY AND IRISH POVERTY. (LEA.DING ARTICLE, vVEmIESDA.Y, JANUARY 6, 1847,) There are occasions when something like harshness is the greatest humanity. When the crew of a sinking ship are crowding into a cockboat, when a panic­struck multitude are trampling one another to death in a narrow passage, when a caravan many days without water gets at last to the pool, there is need of a stern and vigorous hand to check the suicidal efforts of impatience. We are perfectly aware that we have incurred in some quarters the imputation of heart­lessness for some of our su,?gestions on Jri$h affairs. The Irish landlords in general consider that if we had the smallest touch of humanity, we should advise the State to undertake, now and for ever, the relief of their poor, the dis­charge of their mortgages, and the annual subsidy of a few millions to their own worthy selves-that is, to everybody who may choose to prey upon the public re­sources. '\Ve are also thought exceedingly hard to insist on labour, in some tangible arid measurable form, as the condition of relief. Our perse rnrance in 'demanding an effective Poor Law for Ireland is stigmatized as an act of sheer hostility to the owners of the soil. A partion of the English public consider us nothing less than savages, because, when the greatest, most extensive, most difficult, and most costly measure of immediate relief ever attempted by this or any other nation is in full work, and an unexampled demand is made on the attention, the prudence, and the resources of the commonwealth for this one purpose, we do not join the cry for something else, 011 the private and voluntary plan, which to some extent must be instead of tho national measure. The experience of many years' uniuter­mitting discussion of the point assures us, more and more, that for national distress we must look to national remedies. For the hundredth time we renew the cry,­"" Au efl:ective Poor Law for Ireland."" A subscription is merely a scheme for doing very ill what the existing Poor Law and the existing reliefworksca.n doat least very much better. What is still more objectionable is, that it is a shabby ex­cuse in ambush for staving off that real Poor Law, agai11st which three-fourths of the Trish landowners have solemnly de­voted themselves at the altar of selfish­ ness. There are two natural, legitimate, and trustworthy modes of charitable relief-the one really private, the other really public. Whatever you give with your own hand or by the hand of a friend, you have your own or your friend's secu­rity for its proper application. If the State gives it, yon have the national security. If it is collected by a host of amateur tax-gatherers, and distributed as seems fit to my Lord 'l'his and my Lord That, to Bishop So-and-so, with a select rarty of honourables and reverends, then there is not a step in the affair which deserves the least confidence. There is every probability that the tax will be un­fairly assessed . It will be levied from fear, from fashion, from every form of weakness. One man will give more than he likes to do, or ought to db, and a dozE'n others who might give will give nothing at all. The distribution will be even more partial an.<l qnfaii::, There. ts no help for it, . :,_' . The Irish poor niust be relieved by somebody,and the somebody is the'State, in the first instance, operating through these clumsy relief rtcts, shnply for watrt of a regular machinery. For the future -we will take no denial-'--a good old English Poor Law. We in England maintain our own poor ; and, unless the Irish landowners are prepared to see the British public deliberately, formally, and explicitly demanding a summary confis­cation of the whole rnil of Ireland, they mast and shall maintain theirs. This falling back upon the resources of Eng­land is a groat misfortune. It must not be repeated, much less made a regular practice; It is seriously aggravating the dau gers of that commercial crisis which the increasing price of food and of the chief raw material of British manufacture is now daily bringing on. The poor-rates of our great commercial and manufacturing cities in the north indic,ate with alarming certainty the natural effects of leaving a populous province without an effectual provision for the poor. If matters go on at their present rate, Manchester,Liverriool, and a few other cities, will soon be fairly put out, like candles in tropical climates ex­tinguished by swarms of mosquitoes. Shiploads of the most miserable destitu­ tion daily arrive at these devoted shores. By the English law, the starving wretches must be relieved,-in the first instance, at least. So they fly from the Irish landlord to the more generous bosom of the English manufacturer. There they are, and, of course, will not be sent back. The influx has now been going on more than two months, and it is said to be chiefly from Mayo and other western counties, whence they are fairly starved out, and compelled, as well as privately helped, to emigrate, by the very persons whose place it is to maintain them. In the or(isent delectable state of the Irish law, out-door relief is not al~ lowed ; and as the workhou$eB have lon~ been full, charity has reached 1ts full tether. There are now . between fifteen and twenty thousand Irish l)aupers in Liverpool, and it is apprehended th~t the rates will rise in consequence from 2s., the average of former years, to 5s., or even 10s. in the pound. <Jlasgow is in the same caRe, and many other po'l'ts and inland towns are beginning to find Irish 4istre~s broug~-t home to their doors m this very disagreeable manner. In ~fanchester workhouse there are at ,present not Jess than 1,630 inmates. What proportion of these are Irish we cannot no,v say ; but, from the report for the week ending December 24, we learn that in that one week there were 808 Irish cases in which relief was granted, tl1e. amount being, £94 4s. 8d. The increase of Irish cases, as compared with the previous week, was 103, and as compared with the corresponding week the previous year, 371. It is scarcely necessary to ask where this will end. How has it ended already 1 .A. tabular statement of the borough and poor-rate expenditure of Manchester, published in the Man­ehe,ster Courier, exhibits the actual pro­gress of this cancer. The am<?unt paid on account of the poor had nsen. from £20,854 in the year 1835, to £54;ooo in 1845. The amount for the year just ended is not given ; but, as the rate per pound_ h(Ls risen from 3s. to 5s. for the total expenditure, and, as the ex~ penditri:r~ for the poor is the item which undergoes the greatest variations, it would _follow tliat it must have doubled, or someth~ng. like it, on the year 1845. The rate per pound was as low as ls. 4d. in the year 1836. During the dreadful stagnation oftrade it gradually rose to 4s. in 1843. It then fell to 3s., till the Irish influx, it appears, brought it sud­denly up last year to 5s., where it is not likely to stop. It must also be remembered that ,a8 long since as the last census there were residing in Lancashire more than 100,000 persons actually born in Ireland, besides a corresponding number of Irish parentage. Under the late Removal Act, all these, and the swarms that are following in their wake, will acquire virtual settle­ments. This Little Ireland may go on pretty well so long as trade. is brisk. It occupies the cellars and the least healthy suburbs of the towns, and performs those rough:er' offi~s which the division of labour assigns to_ the lowest in the social scale. But at the first blast of a reverse, then the colony begins to show it~elf. In the disastrous period of 1839-42, the Irish were the most numerous, mo13t miserable, and most helpless sufferers. Should another reverse come now-wllich Heaven forbid ! we should find we had a. Mayo on the banks of the Ribble, ana even of the Thames. Now, who will dare to deny that there must be some permanent provision for these unhappy creatures, flying from fala to isle, and from city to city 1 Subjects of this wealthy, this Christian realm~ they must be partakers of the national blessings. Somebody must be responsible for their employment or their mainten­ance. Are they to die by the road-side in Ireland1 Are they to beall fathered on the first English port on which they may happen to cast themselves ? Is it fit, is it wise, that British industry should have the millstone of a whole-Irish population tied round its hecld No. We in Eng­land have sacrificed everything to tho maintenance of our own poor. The land­owners, the farmers, and even the labourers themselves have all been tasked, pressed, mulcte\1; degraded, ruined, and ousted from their property and rights, to ensure a certainty of relief for ; the poor. For generotions the pauper has been the real landlord. Ireland must do what we have done and suffer what we have suffered, in the sacred cause of charity. It must maintain it, own poor.",IRISH PROPERTY AND IRISH POVERTY,2,1/6/1847
"IRISH UNANIMITY. (LEADING ARTICLE, MONDAY, JANUARY 18, 1847.) It hM all along been evident that there was one point on which the chief powers and political leaders of Ireland would be ready to present a beautiful unanimity. To that paramount duty and first article of their faith, the defence of their pockets at any expense of duty and of honour, and to the proportionate plunder of the Imperial T:reasury; lords and common­alty, Orangemen and Repealers, Protest­ants and Roman Catholics, were only too happy to surrender their much-cherished differences, Tara and the Boyne-his Holtness and the Monarch of glorious, pious,and immortal memory-it was clear would be shelved in a moment, as soon as pounds, shillings, and pence should be seen to depend on the union of parties. Well, Ireland. has met. There has. been a convention of the States-General such aa a THEODORE WOLFE TONE would have rejoiced in. By some accident or other which has not yet reached us, it was not held in Donciliatic,n-hall. That Mr. .O'CONNELL was not in the chair is only a piece of that modesty which has often induced him to delegate the throne of the evening to an O'BRrnN, or any other dummy or dupe. As the noble chairman observed, ""the meeting was one of a_ most peculiar construction ; there were persons present of every shade of politics ; in fact, they were assembled together as Irishmen, on Irish ground, for Irish ob­jects.""-"" The hatchet of political ani­mosity was buried for that day at least,"" and the resolutions were carefully accom­modated "" to gentlemen of every creed or class of politics."" The business of the day was arrived at without much preliminary ado. It peeps out like a postscript at the end of a lady's note. It was ""to preserve the property of the country from confiscation."" All classes,all creeds,all politics were to unite and operate in the closest combination. to protect one another's purses from the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER just as passengers sit close in a "" 'bus"" when a man who looks like a member. of the swell mob comes in. In fact, all the world is crying 0 1t at this moment that Irish property should be held responsible for the maintenance and employment of Irish poor. The present catastrophe only adds one more illustration of a truth which every man in this island with brains in his head and a heart in his bosom has held as an ,Lxiom of humanity for these many years. To what effect is the "" United Irishmen's"" reply? It goes straightto the physical force partofthe q ues­tion ;-the glorious right of conspil""acy, "" An understanding between 100 Irish representatives would prevent any Minis~ ter, no mat~er what his politics might be, from tryrng any more crude experi­ments on Irelancl and Irish intt'rests."" (Loud cheers.) This, of course means nothing by itself, but we are not 1~n<> left in suspense ns to the measures which the 100 gentlemen are to oppose or demand. "" What the people most needed "" said Mr. O'CONNELL, "" was food. It wa's most foolish to talk of ""draining and subsoiling, which were very good under ordinary cir cumstances. At present the object of the Irish Partv shoukl be to force the Govern­ment to gi;,e food to the Irish people. This ought to be their first object.'' So now we know what to expect. There you have the prospects of the Ses­sion. Everybody who possesses an acre in Ireland-for it is not confined to Irish Peers and Irish representatives-is to join in impeding. all legislation for that country, and turning at least the Lower House into a beargarden, till it consents to feed all "" the sick and infirm, the fatherless children and widows,"" of Ire­land, to make all the roads, to drain and i;ubsoil every holding, to provide seed. for every cottar, to plough,to dig, to harrow, to sow, to reap, and to carry; to employ every man within a hundred yards of .his own door,-and to do all this, not only by direct and absolute gifts from the Im­perial Treasury, but by gifts of actual food,-not money-but food, lodged in suitable quantities, and at a convenient price, within five minutes' walk of every cottage in the island. One of course asks, "" What next 1"" It is impossible to sup­pose that people who can ask this would be content therewith. The corn, of course, must be ground ; the meal, of course, must be converted into bread or pudding ; and then, with something to give it a relish, and something efae to wash it down, must be_ inserted leisurely and abundantly into each individual's mouth, just when it suits his own private arrangements. The whole cost and trouble of this operation, from the growth of the corn in the Ukraine, down to the final deposit of savoury and convenient morsels within the organ of mastication, will have to be done, we presume, by a commissariat, created, paid, and supplied at the expense of the whole British em­pire. Do we exaggerate in our account of what these "" United Irishmen"" actually demand 1 Not a bit. It is all sad and oober truth. Here is chapter and verse for it, besides wl1at we have quoted above. The first man after the chairman who spoke said that "" the present dis­tressed cbndition of the country was at­tributable to the shipping of the co1mtry not being employed in bringing fc,od to her shores, to the want of seed, which was felt everywhere in the country, and to the present neglected state of their agri­cultural fields."" ""Within the last few days,"" said Mr. O'CONNELL, ""he had heard from an officer of the Board of Works that he had sent £1,000 to a par ticular locality, to be distributed as wages, but there was not JOd. worth of food ,.to be procured there. There was money, but no food, and therefore food should be got at any cost to preserve the people from starvation."" Mr. DILLON CROKER "" censured the Government for not distributing the food which they had in their storehouses to the starving people of Skibbereen, and other distressed districts. Nothing, in fact, but the most vigorous and persistent pressurtl from without would compel the Government to do its duty."" The second resolution, moved by the Earl of ARRAN, after the encouraging an­nouncement that the peasn,ntry, not having made, and not being likely to make, the smallest preparation for the next crop, "" intended to throw the seed on the ground for manure,"" if they should ever get it to throw, declares it n, solemn duty "" to call upon the Government in the mo~t imperative terms to .take such measures as will secure the locvl supplies of food sufficient to keep the people alive, and to sacrifice any quantity of money that may be necessary to attain that ob­ject;"" it further pronounces Government responsible for every dea.th by starvation; it demands the still further use of HER MAJESTY'S Navy for the importation of food : n,nd concludes with the often re­peated, but not less thoughtless request, that relief committees may be allowed to sell corn as much under its market value as they please, the difference being refunded to them out of the Imperial Ex­chequer. To food depots thus authorized to buy in the dearest market n,ud sell in the cheapest at the public oxoense, a re­solution moved by Lord ]!,AR.NHAM adds, "" seed dep6ts "" vested with the same con­venient authority. Now, of course, all these noolemen and gentlemen know what they are about. They know whn,t has been done already by Government ; they must have somo idea what a Government can do,and what it cR,nnot do. They must know that no Government on earth crtn fill a hundred sail of the line with bread n,nd biscuits manufactured by steam out of the shingles on Portsmouth beach, They must also know that the act of purchasing 50,000 quarters of corn for Irish food and seed dep6ts would immediately raise the nrica some 5s. a quarter to everybody in these islands who had not the run of these depots, with the ultimate effect of driving away all privn,te supplies from the very spots where they are most needed. A1 men of education, they must also know the force of language, and the certain effect of telling famished myriads, that they owe their misery to Government's not bringing their daily bread to t-heii: own doors. It is, of course, perfectly useless to reason with men who show themselves so utterly indifferent to the truth or the tendency of their words. But for the benefit of the unfortunate and excitable people whom they are houuding on against Government, we take this opportunity of repeating from, a list in our Saturday's impression, that there are at this moment, either actually em­ployed in carrying food to Ireland rind Scotland, or from one Irish port to another, or actually used as depots on the Irish coast, or loading or preparing for , the service, no less thah 44 ships of HER MAJESTY'S Navy, of which 31 are steamers n,mounting to 7,943-horsfl power ; the total tonnage being 27,523, and the iota! of the crews being more than 3,000. We observe, too, that one of these vessels, the Deo, of 704 tons, 200-horEe power, and 60 men, is carrying provisions from Cork to the peasantry-we must not call them ""the tenantry ""-at Cahirciveen; so that if the proprietor of thn,t justly cele­brated town had possessed the smallest particle of generosity or truth, he ,vould at once have informed the meeting, from the testimony of his own experience and his own pocket, that Govnrnrnent waa doing at very great cost the very thing E they were calling it the murderer of thousands for not doing. But the gist of the day's resolutions was, that whatever is done, it is not to be charged on the oroprietor. The State is to do it, if not entirely in the first instance, yet in that handsome and grow­ing proportion wbich is so 1:ertain to be­come soon identical with the whole. ""No Confiscation,"" is the word. ""vVe solemnly protest,"" says a resolution moved by Lord BERNARD, "" in the name of thA owners and occupiers of land in Ireland, against the principle of charging exclusively on their property the money which they have been forced to waBte on unproductive works."" And then comes that ingenious play on the word"" Imperial,"" by which these Imperial offenders argue that an ""Imperial calamity,"" the result of their own neglect of their duty to the empire, shall be met out of the Imperial Ex­chequer:~ "" That the destruction of the staple food of millions of our fellow-subjects cannot be considered in any other light than that of an Imperial calamity ; and we claim it as our right, that the burden arising from it, so far as it has been ex­pended on unproductive works, shall fall on the empire at large, and not be thrown upon Ireland alone, much less upon those classes in Ireland which have suffered most severely from it."" This, of course, is not all, Not only now, but for the future, Irish poverty, Irish labour, Irish superabundance of population, Irish prisons, asylums, crimi­nal prosecutions, and an endless list of etceteras, are all to be thrown on the Imperial energies and resources. The State, at its own expense, and, of course, on its own responsibility, is to select the very poorest of the peasan'try, and draught them uff by wholesale to the shor""s of America, or anywhere else out of the landlords' way. When the people are tbus disposed of, the State is to take the soil in hand, reclaim wastes, and so forth ; and when it has converted the wilds of Connem~ra into good Lothian farms, it is to sell them back cheap to their former proprietors.",IRISH UNANIMITY,2,1/18/1847
"MEASURES OF RELIE~ (DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT, TUESDAY, JANUARY rn, 1847.) Lord JOHN RussELL, in bringing under the consideration of the House of Commons the state of Ireland, observed that he had never had greater need of its indulgenc~, or so little need of Mking it1 in consequence of the magnitude of the calamity now press­ing on Irelimd, and the further calamity which was still impending over it. He should first proceed to lay down the order in which he should treat the different parts of this groat and important subject. He should clescnbe in ihe first place generally the state in which Ireland was placed owing to this calamity. He should next make a general statement of what had occurred during the recess of Par­liament, of what had been done in pur­suance of the Acts which were passed last session, how far those Acts had been efficient for the purposes for which they had been proposed, and what Government intended to do at the present time and in future to meet the emergency of tho moment. He would then proceed ta invite the House to t}10 cunsidera lion of otl:er mensures, which, in the opinion of Ministers, were calculated to improve the general condition of Ireland, and to lay the foundation of future prospenty and tranquillity. He would also mention some other subjects, which, though they had been under the consideratinn of Government, had not bem1 so fully con­sidered, and were not yet matured, and the views of Government upon them. He would then ask leave to bring in two Bills -one to render valid certain acts which had been done under the authority of the LORD-LIEUTENANT, as commu­nicated in the letter of Mr. LABOU­CHERE ; and the other a Bill for the improvement of private estates, in ac­c::irdance with the Treasury minute of the 1st of December last, which was already known to the House. In considering the state of Ireland at present, he used the guarded language of the reports of the Commissioners of Inquiry on Poor Laws in that country, and left the House to infer therefrom how severely the calamity of a total failure of the potato crop must be felt there. Having read several extracts from the first and third reports of that Uonimission, to show how wretched lhe usual state of Ireland was, he asked how those, who were on the brink of famine in ordinary times, could bear up against it under a calamity which was alm<Jst without parallel in modem times, which acted upon eight millit,ns of people, and which reminded him of a famine of the 13th centnry acting upon the population of the 19th century 1 He then mentioned the course which had been adopted to meet this disaster from its commencement to the present Ume. He described the pro­ceedings under the presentment system and the Labour Rate Act. He showed that under those enactments the employment of so many men in unproductive labour had become full of danger, bnt that the danger would have been much greater had the Government confounded that species of labour with independent labour, and so injured the great anrl important class to which all the labourers generally belonged. He also called attention to the fact, that no public body could suffi­ ciently superintend the employment of so large a number of persons as were novr engaged under the Board of Works'. The staff itself was liable to abuse, for it con­sisted of not less than 11,587 per11ons. The number of persons employed last week was 480,000, and it was probably. at present half a million. No doubt there was great nse in employing these persons, and in furnishing them with labour. Taking each of these persons as providing for four others, that employment found food for 2,000,000 of souls. The expense of this employment was enormous. During the present month alone it had amounted to £700,000 or £800,000. It was impossible to view it without seeing that it must be productive of great con­comitant evils. One of them harl been that the labour was inefficiently per­formed. To remedy that evil, task-work had been substituted ; but from task­work another evil had sprung up, and it was this-that many of the labourers obtained by it greater wages than were ever before gained in Ireland, wages vary­ing from ls. 4d. to ls. 10d. a-day. The consequence was, that farmers occupying from 20 to 60 acres had obtainfld tickets from the relief committees, had put their sons on the relief works, had thus re­ceived the money which was intended only for the destitute, and, what was worse, had prevented those who were really destitute from receiving it. lb therefore appeared desirable to the Government to form in certain districts­sar, the electoral districts-relief com­mittees, which should be empowerad-to receive subscriptions, levy rates, and receive donations from the Government; that out of the sums thus raised they should purchase food, establish soup kitchens, and deliver rations from this purchased food to the famishing inhabit­ants ; and that,' in furnishing that food, they should not look to any particular test of destitution, but should set the labour­ing men who applied to them to work either on their own grounds or on those of the neighbouring farmers, so as to earn for themselves some small wages by their own industry. After the GovEJrn­ment in England had considered this scheme, they had communicated it to the LORD-LIEUTENANT of Ireland, to the head of the Board of Works, and to the head of the commissariat in that country. Those functionaries had received it favourably, and the Government was, therefore, determined by prepara~ory measures in Ireland, and by a Bill to be introduced into Parliament, to carry it into e:""ect ; and he was sure that the House would be glad to hear that Sir JoHN BuRGOY;>,E had consented to super­intend its operation for the next three months. In proposing this maasure, however, with a view of affording, if possibie, a more effectual mode of giving a relief of food to those who wanted it, and of setting free labourers from the public works for the ordinary avocations of agriculture, we must take care that this substitution should be made as easily as possible by not dismissing large bodies of labourers at once, and that when it was made, no further presentments should be offered and no further employment given on the public works. With respect to the money which had already been ex­pended, and w\).ich was now to be ex­pended, on public works in Ireland, a claim had been advanced that the whole of it should not be made a burden upon that country. Considering how exten­sive the calamity was, he thought that it would only -be right that the whole burden should not fall on Ireland. He should, therefore, propose on a future day, that in each succeeding year as each instalment was paid, one-half should be remitted, keeping up the whole debt until one-half of it was paid, and then throwing .the other half of it on the public. The money already issued for these \vorks had been issued out of the balances now in the Exchequer charged on the Consolidated Fund, and he was happy to say that there had been no issue of Exchequer bills to meet that expendi­ture. It had of course placed a. burden B2 on the finances of the empire, and he should, therefore, be disabled from bringing forward some propositions for the reduction of duties on soap, sugar, tea, &c., which he was i11clined to have made, and which it was hardly fair that the people of Great Britain should not receive. With respect to the advances made to proprietors who had expressed a desire to make improvement on their estates, under the authority of the LoRD­LIEUTENANT's order, Government thought that the terms contained in the Treasury minute of the 1st of last Decem her should be extended to them, and that the timf3 for the re-payment of the advances which they had received should be extended Irom 10 to 22 years, as in the Drainage Act of last session. Having thus stated what the Government intended to propose to meet the evil of the present year, he proceeded to observe that there was o.nother proposal, of which, though of doubtful tendency, he was inclined to try the experiment. He proposed to advance £50,000, to be repaid on or J:,efore the 31st of December, 1847, to the proprietors of Ireland to furnish seed for sowing their lands. He did not intend to advance anypart of it to the small cottier-tenants, as it might not [be used for the purposes for which it was lintended ; but he thought that if the advance were made to the pro­prietors of the soil, the measure might be safe and useful. In stating these proposi­tions to the House, he felt bound to say that Government could not, 11nd did not, expect to be able to ward off entirely the effects of the awful visitation under which Ireland was now labouring. It was not in the power of man to do away with the ordinations of .PROVIDENCE, and it was a knowledge of that fact which led him to express his astonishment that two such eminent and respectable individuals as the Marquis of SLIGO and Mr. MooRE should have called upon their countrymen to meet at Castlebar, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament to take steps to insure ""an immediate cheap .and constant supply of fond "" during the famine which surr,mnded them and was still impending. That was a task bevond all human power to accomplish. All that any human Go­vernment could do was to alleviate some­whatthe present dreadful calamity, and to save the great bulk of the people ; and it must not be imagined that it could turn scarcity into plenty. What, how­ever, astonish@d liim the most was, that a meeting for surih a purpose as that which he had just described should have been called at Castlebar, where there was a union workhouse capable of containing 600 persons, but not containing at present more than 130 persons, its doors being closed, and the guardians alleging that they could not levy the rates neces­sary to support the workhouse. He saw in the proposal of the noble Marquis itn unhappy tendency, which he had seen on other occasions in Ireiand, to recommend others to perform vague, impracticable, and visionary duties, while the plain and practicable duty of paying rates for the sustenance Qf starving men, women, and children in the nei8'hbourhood was neglected. He was obliged to say that while the Government would attempt all that was practicable, it would refuse to make any promise which was clearly im­practicable. He then proceeded to another part of his subject-namely, that which related, not to the present, but to the permanent benefit of Ireland. Al­though we had been diverted by extra­ordinary circumstances from general prin­ oiples, it was expedient that we should return t'o them as soon as possible. The intel'fereiice of Government might be gi:ven in three ways, which ought to be kept separ.tte and distinct. With the support of Parliament, it might give assistance by loan to individuals anxious to improve their property. It might also ~ve assistance by grant of public money m the construction of works of evident pub­lic utility. It might also enact that relief should be given by law to the infirm and destitute. The first mea.sure which he proposed to bring forward, founded on the first of these three modes of inter­forence, was based on the Drainaire Act of last session, and on the terms ~given to the public in the Treasury minute of December last.. It was intended that where an improvemen~ of an estate was proposed to be made either by draina~e or the reclamation of wa_ste lands, certam advances should be made from the public funds. The usual rate of interest on advanctJs made by the Treasury was 5 per cent. ; by the Drainage Act of last session it was fixed at 3½ per cent. ; and he now proposed to extend the terms of the Drainage .A.ct to the improvements which he had just mentionecl. He also proposed with regard _to more general works to consolidate and amend the Drainage Acts now on the statute book. By the p,resent Drainage .Acts the proprietors of a district' might meet-they might propose to obtain a loan for the improvement of a diiit,l'int. hv drainave-and, if the nlan -oro­ posed was approved by the majority, the loan could be made and the drainage effected. In that case the drainage was undertaken by the Board of 'Works. Now, this Act was only applicable to the drainage of streams and rivers. He pro­posed to apply it to other obj.ects, and tlierefore a consolidation and amendment of the Acts was necessary. He also pro­posed, on the same principle on which other great works were adopted by the State, to undertake by the State the reclamation of waste lands in Ireland. The waste lands of Ireland had been cal­culated by Sir R. KANE at 4,600,000 acres ; Government proposed to devote a million sterling to the purpose of reclaim­ing them. It further proposed that the waste land, if the proprietor were inclined to dispose of it, should be purchased by the public ; but if the proprietor refused to improve it, as well as to sell it, then a compulsory power should he lodged in tl10 Commissioners of Woods and Forests to take. .and cultivate it. Such land, however, must be below the annual value of 2s. 6d. an u.cre. Land of this nature was to be improved by the Woods and Forests only so far as roads and bridges went ; the reclamation of tlie land was not to be undertaken by that department. When reclaimed, it was to be divided into small lots, say of 25 acres each, and might either be sold outright at once, or let to a tenant for a certain number of years, to be sold at the end of that time. He expected that great advantage would arise from this plan, for a great many persons who were now driven into despair and crime owing to the enormous demand now existing for land, would be placed on these reclaimed lands, and would thus be able to obtam a competent living from their labour. He now came to the class of measures founded on the third mode of interference. And first, of the relief to the destitute. It would be remembered that when the Poor Law Commission of Inquiry made its report, it advised that all persr.ns of a certain class should be relieved; and in that class it included all persPns infirm, aged, and permanently disabled. The Government thought it safer to have workhouses erected in Ireland, to allow relief to the destitute able-bodied as wail as to the ag(d and infirm, and to confine it to the workhouse. It was n,,w its opinion, formed on a general virw of Irelan:.l, that the Poor Law should he more extensive than it is. He frerefore prop0sed to bring in a Bill for the more effectual relief of the destitute poor of Ireland, which would enact that ; guardians of the poor be required to give relief, either in or out _of thP. workhouse, to the aged and infirm, and to all who were permanently disabled. This would be the means, first, of enabling the Boards of Guardians to use ~he workhouse as a test of destitution ; and, secondly, of enabling them to afford relief to infirm and aged persons at their own homes, with greater satisfaction to the feelings of the people, and with a hope of producing a better working of the law. He also proposed that when the workhouses were full, the Poor Law Commissioners should have power to enable Boards of Guardians to give relief out of the house to the able­bodied poor. '.!.'his power must be ;.,3ed with caution. The workhouses ought to be kept as a test of destitution; but there were cases where they cc,uld not afford accommodation to all who crowded to their doors, and in such cases aid must be given out of doors, not in money, but in food. Relieving-officers also would be appointed, and in cases of urgent neces­sity, where there was danger of starva­tion, must be empowered to take the parties into the workhouse, or to relieve them out of the workhouses until the next meeting of the Board of Guardians, when relief could be afforded according to the general rules. Such were tlie measures which he proposed to introduce immediately, There were other measun,s, however, still in contemplation of the Government, of which one was a measure for facilitating the sale of encumbered estates. He also proposed to introduce a Bill by which long leasehold tenures renewable for ever should he converted into freeholds. The various tenures of land in Ireland were a great evil ; and it was a matt.er worthy of Parliament tu consider how far those tenures could be simplified, and the landlord be connected with the tenant and the labourer, as in England. It was owing to this want of connexion between them in Ireland that it was almost impossible to discover who was the party on whom, in the urgent distress of the counky, the duties of pro­perty become obligatory. Under the second head of public works came fisheries ; but he had no definite proposi­tion to submit to Parliament on that sub-, ject at present. In the course of last autumn a large supply of fish had been eaught on the west coast of Ireland, but, from want of salt, it had been thrown 011 the land for manure, instea4 of being cured for the food of man. He trusted that before the end of the session he should be prepared with a Bill 011 that subject. There was another subject­emigration-on which he intended to make no proposition, though extravagant exp0ctations, which never could be realized, were entertained respecting it in Ireland. Pauper families could not be removed so as to produce any sensible effect on the population either by public or by private means. This point was to be considered. If you were greatly to assist emigration, and to convey a million of men beyond the ocean, whctt funds and means are there in the countries to which you remove them 1 If by a large addition to the burdens of the country vrn were to remove hundreds of thousands of men to the United States, the people of that country would compiain, and justly, that we were casting upon them paupers whom Vie ought to maintain ourselves. If w~ ""were to remove them to our own colanies, the s ame complaints would be made by them-we should reduce them to ruin, and create beggars in abun­dance where we now had industrious and happy settlers. Lord JORN RussELL then described the measures which he had adopted when he held tlrn seals of the Colonial Department to promote emigra­tion by taking charge of the emigrant at the port of his disembarcation, and by conveying him thence to the field of employment. He showed that there had been in consequence a large increase in the amount of emigration during the years 1845 and 1846, and affirmed that under such circumstances he should be afraid of giving a stimulus to further emigration. There were, however, some difficulties in the way of emigration con­tained in the Passenger Act which he intended to remove, but he cou1d give no hope of an extensive scheme of emigm­tion. He knew not whether the cakula­tion of Sir R. KANE was a sober one ; but that eminent individual maintained that there were such extensive agricultural resources-to say nothing of mineral re­sources-in Ireland th:1t it; could maintain 17 millions of inhabitants without difficulty. He (Lord J. RUSSELL) was himself of opinion that if a good system of agriculture were introduced into Ireland-if anything like permanent security were afforded for the investment of capital-if tl:e proprietors would im­prove their lands-and if their tenants and labourers would co-operate with them, the present population of Ireland wa; not excessive. He then alluded to certain countries whichhad been formerly in. a colldition as wretched as Ireland, and which were now flourishing in order, peace, and civilization. He entered upon that retrospect because there were some inclined to despair of Ireland. He saw no reason, unconnected with laws which had ceased to exist, and with unhappy circum­stances to which he would not advert, why Ireland should not rise at a future day to as great prosp2rity. The noble Lord then read a melancholy description of England by Sir '1'. MORE, and another, equ~""lly miserable, of Scotland at the end of the 16th century, to show that there was no reason to despair of Ireland becoming heraafter orderly and civilized. He knew that what he had touched on was but a part of the case. He did not mean to argue that apart from political rights and institutions a merely benevolent Govern­ment could make a country flourish. There were things which the Crown could not grant, and which Parliament could not enact ; and among them was a spirit of self reliance. He should despiir indeed of the task which he had under­taken if he had not seen of late in Ireland symptoms of greater reliance on its own exertions, and a greater willingness to co-operate with others. If its inhabitants would but encourage that feeling among themselves, and would !00k at what had been effected in England and Scotland by industry, perseverance, and self-reliance -if they would but see the task before t,hem, and set themselves steadily to per­form it-there were circumstances in Ireland which might still bring this matter to a happy issue. The fertility of its land was an object of universal admiration ; the strength and industry of its inhabitants, when removed from its soil, enabled them to compete with smcess with the sturdy labourers of Great Britain at Liverpool, Glasgow, and London. There may have been faults and defects hitherto ; but happy shall we be if we now lay the foundation of the cure for those defects ; and still more happy will Irishmen be if they adopt as , their maxim-"" Help yourselves, and Gon will help you ;"" and then he trusted that they would find that there had been some uses in their present adversity. He moved for leave to bring in a Dill to make valid certain proceedings taken under Mr. LABOUCHERE's letter. The noble Lord then concluded, amid loud and universal cheering, a speech which took more than two hours and a half in the delivery.",MEASURES OF RELIE~,4,1/26/1847
"COST OF RELIEF. (LEADING ARTICLE, TUESDAY, J.ANU.iRY 26, 1847.) It may, perhaps, be our own fault, but certainly the measures for Ireland, as sketched by Lorri JonN RussELL bst night, fill our whole souls with dis­may. Of course, it is odious to talk about expense when famine is rnid to be killing its thousands ; and of course it is very unpatriotic to stint the benevol3nce or to doubt the ability of England. But there are impi;essions against which it, is impo3sible to struggle, and the impres­sions left on us by Lord JOHN'S speech of last nighr, are of the most invincible character. It really adds to tho supposed climax of Irish affairi'. Never let any one pretend to be satis!Ied that he knows the worst of that country. Depend on it, there is a worse still in store. It has been called an incubus, a burden, a mill­stone, a chaos, a ditch, a slough of despond, a Maelstrom. Alas ! these are feeble i-xpressions. They are much too finite. Under the heaviest burden you can only fall to the ground. A ditch, a bog, a Charybdis itself has a bottom. Not so Irefand. Of all human things it presents the nearest approach to an infinite -idea. Each year opens to the awe-struck soul a perpetual increasing vista of misery, trouble, animosity, expense, mismanagement, and ingrati­tude ; and certainly we must confess that the plainest and largest revelation of this sort, as long as we remember, w~1s that of last night. H is possible we may owe the prodigious character of the vision to the far-sightedness of the Ministerial Siler. We only s:ty it is most prodigious. In the first place, half the expense of the public works :now in progress by the presentment of baronfal sessions under the Act of last session is to be undertaken at once by the Treasury. These works are now employing, if em­ploying it can be called, half a million of men, and thereby supporting two million persons. It is:i"" a choice of evils,"" to use an expression which has become a stereo­type for n,rtk]es 011 Irish :,ffair:i, whl'th( f this htllf-million sb,'111 earn very little' and work still le,,s, or shall get dece~t wages on task-work. The latter alte~11:1­tive has been taken in consequence of the representati@n of tmvellers, r,s Lord JoJIN informs us, who, seeh,g va.st rr.u]tituJes amusing themselves on the road-dde, were told that they were engaged (\11 l;lrn relief works. ,vheu task-work was intro« duced, it became possible to earn some­thing; like an English labourer's wages, and the small farmers forthwith rushed to the roads, even to the exclusion of the really destitute class. The enormous aggregate is still rapidly increasing. The present rate of cost is still about £800,000 a-month ; and before there can be any check to the system some three or four millions will have been spent. The Imperin,l Exchequer is to bear half at once. It is pronounced impossible, there­fore, to repeal or reduce it single burden. Tea,soap, mult,windows, are all to continue as they were. Nobody must dream of relief, in this island, for a twelvemonth at least. But there is to be a change. What 1 From more to less expense ? From laxity to rirrour and dhcrimination ? From in­com1?etent 'tO competent control 1 Vain thought! Inasmuch as the ""relief"" mobs are n<'gkcting their ord.ina.ry agricultural hbours, and -the new roads at the same time 11re not of much use, "" relief "" com­mittees are to be '' holped ''with money to gii'e mt,ions of food to everybody at their discretion, while the said everybody is working on his own land or his neigh­bour's. The change is, that instead of public works and public superintende:nce, there are to be private works, or no works, and no superintendence. \Vhat is now to hinder the whole popuhtion of Ireland from being pat on the relief lists 1 \Yill a rnillion 11-month suffice for nt least a. million of wen, paid and r,dually fed to dig and sow their own land? Ann this, we are told, is inoYitable ! l'rny suppress your murm~rs. It is"" a cl:oice of el'ib.'' But there is more and more still. Tl1e procession of relief measures, of all sr.rts of sizes, is infinite. As the sailor said of thfl r0pe he was drawiI1g 1p the s.hi;i 's side, some one must h[;,ve eut the ofoe:t ena off. You h:1ve 11ev2r seEm the last. '.l.'!i:ere is to be a,other J\Iillion Act for dra.in:,ge, with incr81\~ed facilities and easier terms. Governr.,<'nt is also to lend money for ::,aed. Gov<>:rm»,mt, aga.in, is to lend money for the roda:rn::L:m of waste lanes; er, if the p;:oprietors do not choose to rw,,il 1homselves of the profli.lred o:Jpor­tunity, it Js to p1:..:chaso tlio waste lands, rtd.,1,im them, and divide them into small farms of :10 or SO acres for poor, ejected people. The ""relief "" tenants, of course, as being poor and ejected, will want not only land, but everything else­houses, implements, seed, cattle, and, to crown all, the food and clothing for the twelvemonth or more that must neces­.sarily elapse before the land begins to bear, not to speak of future contingencies. There are, however, two or three stray bits of promise in this multifarious an­nouncement. The Poor Law is to be ex­tended, and out-door relief allowed when the workhouse is full. But, as yet, there is nothing to show that it shall be com­pulsory, except in the case of those ""who are permanently disabled by bodily infirmity."" The proprietor may, and, judging from the past, most probably will, leave ordinary destitution to its fate. Again, it is not proposed that Govern­ment shall ease the landowner of his surplus population, and cast the naked and hungry crowd on a foreign shore. That looks like being able to rny "" No "" to an Irish landlord. But the question still waits for an answer. If the railway companies of Canada will accept money from Government to build habitations for emigrant labourers on the line, then there will be a Government emigration, Were it only possible to see an end, though ever so distant ! The nation would be saved much anxiety if some limit or other were fixed. The human mind sinks under the infinite. Let it be laid down at once that Ireland is to pay no ta:l'es, and that every man, and woman, and child in the island is to !Je main­tained suitably to his or her rank at the Imperial expense ; that the land is to be tilled, the harvest reaped, and the rent collected for the landlords by Tre~sury grants. Put it down at £10,000,C00 a-year, and ask no receipts. Great Britain is strong and industrious. It can do almost anything it attempts, solong as it knows what is to be done. Set it a task, and it will do it. We shall soon be familiarized with the item. The returns will give the army so many millions, the navy so many millions, the interest of the debt so many, and Ireland so many. We are quite confident of the power of Great Britain to maintain all Ireland, the landlords in luxury and the peasantry in comfort. It is only laying on a few more taxes-saydoublingtheinco;:ne-tax-doing without a few more comforts, and working a few more hours out of the twenty-four. What is an Englishman made for but to work ? What is a Irishman made for but to sit at his cabin-door, read O'CONNELL'S speeches, and abuse the English ? '.l'he English are ready to do anything, if they can only see the end. This is, indeed, the secret of the marvellous unanimity and delight with which Lord JOIIN's an­nouncement was greeted. Sir ROBERT INGLIS, indeed, thought that when every­thing whatt;ver was to be given t.hat could be given in the way of money, he saw scimBthing like an end. He dreamt of Ireland c.:mverted into a vast college of pensioners on British bounty, eating, drinking, sleeping, praying, and washing themselves like good Christians. Waking from so agreeable a vision, what wonder that he should thank Lord JoIIN for his boundless munificence ? Diilcis insania I Sorry are we to dispel so agreeable a delu­sion ; but it would take more millions than even England can bestow to give it reality and effect.",COST OF RELIEF.,2,1/26/1847
"GOVERNMENT AND IRISH RAILWAYS. {DEBATE IN PARLIAMENT, FRIDAY, l<'EBRUARY 5, 1847.) In the House of Commons Lord G. BENTINCK, in moving for leave to bring in a "" Bill to stimulate the prompt and pro­fitable employment of the people, by the encouragement of railways in Ireland,"" observed, that when he recollected that this Bill had been prepared by men of such powerful understanding as Mr. HuusoN, Mr. R. STEPHENSON, and Mr. .LAING, he had no objection to take upon himself the exclusive blame and responsi­.bility of introducing it to the notice of Parliament. When 500,000 men, com­manded by a staff of 11,587 officer!l, were living on the funds of the State and em­ployed on works productive of no other result than that of obstructing the public communications, he felt that a great calamity must be overhanging Ireland ; but he did not on that account look with despondency on the present state ofaffairs in that country. He was convinced that the best mode of overcoming its difficul­ties was by stimulating the employment of her people, and to that object he now proposed to apply himself. In 1836 a report was presented by the Commis­sioners of Inquiry into Railroads in Ire­land, recommending that a system of rail­ways should be carried out in thatconntry, and that it should be carried out by the assistance of Government. The recommen­dation of that report had since been re­ported by Lord DEVON'S Commission, which confirmed and sanctioned it. Some years ago Acts of Parliament had been passed for 1,582 miles of railway in Ire­land, but as yet only 123 miles had been completed, and not more than 156 miles additional would be completed in the present year. There mnst, therefore, be some. weakness which prevented those works from being carried out in Ireland which had been successfully acco~plished in England, where 2,600 miles of rail­road had already been completed, and where 4,600 miles more were at present in course of preparation. The proportionate population in England and in Wales was as near as possible on a par with that in Ireland ; and in all railway specula­tions Mr. HunsoN deemed population to be the first element of success. If he were told thr,t the population of Ireland was incapable of travelling from poverty and want-of means, he would reply that the results on the existing Irish railways gave a flat drnial to any such assertion. If, then,thoro were promise of such profit in railway enterprise in Ireland, how was it that private speculators in England did not come forward to invest capital in it 1 He could not answer the question-he only knew that the fact was so, arising, perhaps, partly from fashion and partly from want of confidence, and that the result was that some of the best specula­tions in Ireland bad stuck fast from want of money. As, then, there was this general distrust in the English money market, his proposition was that the Government should come to the aid of the railway compa1iies. His plan .was that for every £100 expended on the rail­way by the companies, £200 should be lent by the Government, at the same interest at which it borrowed the money. It might be said that money thus lent would be lent at a less rate of interest than could be got elsewhere, and that it would be lent on insufficient seourity. Ho then proceeded to refute these ob­jections, and to show that the security afforded to the State in this way would be a sufficient security. Mr. Hunsi:JN, the chairman of 1,700 miles of railroad, was ready to pledge his commercial credit that the State would not lose a single shilling by acceding to this proposition. Mr. HunsoN had informed him tl1at the worst railroad under his direction was capable of affording cent. per cent. se­curity to the Government ; and he had documents to prove--which he read to the House-that the worst railroads in Belgium and Germany would afford suf­ficient security for such a loan as he had proposed. He would assume the interest of money to be now 3½ per cent., and if the line were to pay £7 on everv £200., that would afford ample security ; but he undertook to prove that there would not be a single line in Ireland which 'l\""OUld not pay more than that sum. He next undertook to show that the effect of pass­ing the measure which he then proposed would so stimulate the employment of English capital in Ireland that it would forthwith complete all the railroads of that country. To carry that measure into effect he proposed that the Railroad Com­missioners appointed under the Act of last year should be formed into 'a Board, re­sponsible to Parliament for dealing out those loans. He woul<l throw on that Board the responsibility of the full per­formance of the various duties imposed upon it, and wollld enact that unless the Board certified at once that the railway would be beneficial, and was a sufficient security, the State should not advance any money to the promoters of it. Having explained to the House the situation in which his proposition would -place the shareholders, ho next exhibited the double effects which it would produce upon labour. It would set to work an immense mass of labourers on the rail­roads, and would at the same time enable the shareholders to set free their money for the improvement of their own estates, and to employ an additional number of men in their cultivation. As an instance of the results likely to arise from his plan, he mentioned that such a loan as he had described, made to the Kil­kenny,Limerick,aud Waterford Railroad, would set at onoe 16,000 men to work, and that, too, in four baronies alone, which had been paying £4,000 a month for unproductive works, with a prospect of continuing th-at payment for some months. He thought it better that the advances should be made directly to the railroad companies than through the security of the land ; for it appeared to him to be impossible to assess 'on the land any rate which was to be applicable to the future maintenance of railways. Such were the le.1ding fe.1tures of his plan ; and in producing it to the House he did not bring it forward either in hostility or rivalry to Lord J. RussELL. Though the plan had originated at the house of Sir J. TYRRELL, and though the Bill had been drawn up ever since last November, still, with the exception of the hon. member for Harwich, it had not been communi­cated tJ any Irish Railway Company or to any gentleman connected with Irish pro­perty. It might be ffiid that this measure was more favourable to the proprietors of Ireland than that which they had for­merly proposed themselves. It might be so ; but the reason for introducing it was not so much to benefit the landed interest of Ireland asto stimulate the employment of the bbour of that country. He showed that such would be the effect of it by re­minding the Houso that plans had been or were before it for completing 1,500 miles of railroad in Trelancl. Now, to ex­ecute those works 60 men would be wanted for each mile for four years. 1,500 miles would, therefore, give employ­ment to 90,000 men for four years on earth-works aud the line of road. It was estimated that the employment to arti­ficers on those roads would occupy six men a mile. That would employ 9,000 more. Moreover, a railway, in making new fences, in squaring fields, and in making drains, watercourses, and roads, would occupy as many men as were P-n­gaged in c,mstructing it. Thus, alto­gether, 109,000 persons would be em­ployed,independently of the other miscel­laneous occupations to which the expendi­ture of so large a body of men would necessarily give rise. He therefore esti­mated that this measure would give em­ployment to 110,000 perwns, represent­ing, with their families, 550,000 souls. If, then, by a measure such as this, cost­ing the country nothing and leaving it some profit, he could feed 550,000 souls for four years he thought that he should go a long way in sssisting Lord ,T.RusSELL to carry out his Act for the Amendment of the Irish Poor L,1.\. ; for, independently of its other advantages, his arrangement would afford the Board of Guardians ad­ditional means of providing labour for able-bodkd IJOrsons out of employment. He then informed the House that he had inserted in his Bill clauses providing that the contractors should pay their labourers once a week and in hard cash, and that if any of them should postpone the payment from Saturday to Monday, or longer, he should be compelled to pay double wages for every day during which the payment was postponed. He had also inserted a clause by which the railway companies, on the demand of the Railroad Commis sioners, would be compelled to provide suitable huts and lodgings for their labourers b3fore the works of the rail roads commencEd. He then proceeded to conRider th0 effects which would be produced upon lreland generally by the construction of these railways. He cal­culate.I the improvement of the land, one mile on each side of each r<1ilway, to be sufficient to pay for the construction of the railways themselves, estimating that in 25 years it would add £23,000,000 to the landed property of Ireland. He also calculated that these railways, when com­pleted, besides relieving the county cess from supp'.1rting 550,000 souls, would pay £22,500 a-year to the poor-rates1 for tho purpose of maintaining the agect, infirm, and impotent. Inducements like these would call forth the capital of the country ; and he had no doubt that, if his Bill met the approbation of tho House, "" week would not elapse without its being poured into Ireland,and without 200,000 labourers being employed at once on the railroads. Whatthenwouldhappen? Land would have to bcl bought for these railroads. On those already constructed £170 an acre had been paid to the land­lord, and £20 to the occupying tenant for his rights. The effect of his measure in this way would be to place £1,250,000 in tho hands of Irish proprietors for the employment of fresh labour,and £240,000 in the hands of the occupying tenants for their own purposes. He then came to the bearing of this measure on the re­venue. He had heard it said that his plan of raising £16,000,000 on the secu­rity of £8,000,000, to be applied to rail­roads, would knock down the funds, de­press the money market, and operate as a screw on the trading and manufact.uring interest,s of the country. He , id not think that it would have any appreciable effect if the necessarv sums were raised at intervals of three months, as was done in 1835 in tho case of the loan of £15,000,000 for the emancipation of the negroes ; and they must be timid finan­ciers indeed who anticipated any miscbief from it. Even if he had not the experi­ence of the loan of 1835 tc direct him, he should say that money spent in the country and not out of it, and spent, too,for the advantage of productive and native industry, must be beneficial to the funds and to the trading interest of thfl empire. Whilst he was thus callin""' (;TI his country to leud to Ireland £16,000,000 at the rate at which it borrowed it, and without any further charge, he felt it right to state tha,t the CIUNCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER,when he advanced Joans to public works, did not stand in the same position as a private capitalist, who looked to nothing but the payment of his principal and interest. He was sure that the right hon. gentleman, when he looked back at the great things which the sums spent in the constructionofrailways had done for the revenue, would agree with him iu thinking that the State would be a sleeping partner in this concern. It would ren,p from the expenditure of £24,000,000 on railways in Ireland an enormous increase of revenue in the in­creased consumption of articles of excise and customs. .After declaring that it was a scandalous calumny to assert that Eng­lish loans to Ireland had never been re­paid, and after quoting the report of Lord DEvoN's Commission to corroborate that declaration, he proceeded to eulogize the good faith of the Irish people and to give sereral striking instances of it. He then denied the danger of any outbreak in Ire­land, and expressed his belief that the peasantry, who had purchased firearms, had not purchased tl1em for any disloyal purpose. He was then commencing his peroration, when he recollected that he had not uttered a word respecting the manner in which this loan was to be re­paid. It was his intention that the inte­rest of the loan should commence on the day of its being advanced, and that the principal should be repaid in 30 years, by instalments, commencing seven years after a certificate was given of the com­pletion of the railway. He then returned to his panegyric on the character of the Irish people, eulogized their patience amid the most direful suffering, and con­cluded by saying, that if, by his measure, he could fill their bellies with good beef and mutton, and their cottages with fine wheat and sound beer, and. their pockets with English gold, to purchase the blankets of Wiltshire, the fustians of Manchester, and the cotton prints of Stockport, he, though a Saxon, would answer with his head for their loyalty, and would lead them, through their warm hearts and sympathies, not to sever but to cement the union of Ireland with England. The noble lord then con­cluded a speech which lasted for more than two hours and a half, amid loud and long cheers from all sides of the Hnuse. Lord J. IlussELL l:aving paid a well­turned compliment to the patriotism of Lord G. BENTINCK and to his ability, both in framing and expounding his plan, wished that it had been snch that he could have adopted it, in aid of the plans which he had brought forward for the relief of the Irish poor. In point of fact, the matter, not the plan, which Lord G. BENTINCK had brought forward had been for some time past under the con­sideration of HER MAJESTY'S Government. Some years ago Lord MoRPETH, on behalf of the Government, had brought forward a plan of railroads, which he (Lord J, RuESELL) thought, and still considered, likely to benefit Ireland. Lord MORPETH contemplated the construction of railways by Government, of which the returns were calculated to produce 4 per cent. interest on the money advanced, and which were to be applied, in case they produced more than 4 per cent., to the reduction of fares and to the extension of branch railways. It was thought that such a plan, which would have given the Government a con­trol over the railroads very useful for the forwarding of the mail:, and other pur­poses, would have been much superior to that adopted in England, where the rail­roads had grown up almost free from all GovernmeDt control. But that was not Lord G. BENTINCK's plan. .Adverting to the details of tbat plan, he observed that he did not consider it advisahle for Go­vernment to step out of its proper sphere to interfere with the general investment of capital and to foster one set of com­panies at the expense of another. He then statsd, that when the railway com­panies of Ireland waited on him with a proposition that Government should add £5,000,000 in three years to the £10,000,000 which they would expend in the same time, he had considered it prin­cipally in its bearing on the relief of tho then existing distress. The funds at bis disposal were not large, but limited. Of all wants, the most pressing was the want of food inthe remoter districts of Ireland. Now he found that the 1,pplication of money to Irish railroads would not have benefited those districts at all ; for in looking to the counties through which the proposed railways were to pass, he found that they were the most .flourishing in Ireland. Railroad labour, therl'fore, would not have applied to ihe districts which were most distressed, and fo which it was necessary that the attention of Government should be first drawn. He did not mean to deny that tbe establish­ment of railroads in Ireland would be of great permanent benefit to it., but having a case of extreme destitution before him, he did not think it wise to devote £16,000,000,to the promotion of railroads; for if Government did rn, it ,vould cbeck other expenditure much more necessary and immediate. He did not, however, intend to oppose the motion for leave to bring in this Bill. In saying so, he hoped that he should not hereafter be accused of deception if on a future occasion he should give it decirle<l opposition. He thought that it would not be wise to adopt this scheme. In a future stage of the Bill it ,rnuld be necessary to go into a Committee of the whole Houso to r,pprove a grant of public money to carry it into effect, On that occ:rnion it would be in­cumbent on the Government either to adopt the scheme as their own or to put a decided negative on it. Now he was not prepared for the first alternative, and should therefore adopt the latter, J\{fr. B. OSBORNE expres2ed his admira­tion of tte bold, grand, and comprehen­sive plan just propounded to tho House by Lord G. BENTINCK, and his delight at seeing his great and powerful energies ap­plied to the consiJerntion of the condi­tion of Ireland. He should give his warmest support to his motion. Mr. ROEBUCK was sorely vexed a,t the course adopted by Lord J, RusSELL in giving his assent to the introduction of this Bill, which he intended to destroy on a future occasion. Ho for one should oppose the introduction of the Bill alto­gether, for he objected to the taxation of the industrious people of England for the investment of their capital in any specu­lation whatsoever. We were now sup­porting millions of the' lrish people at an expense of more than half the money which, after paying the interest on the National Debt, remained for carrying on the government of this great country ; and yet we were to be accused of hr,rd­heartedness, and to be assailed,with many other harsh expressions, if they objected, on the part of the suffering people of Eng­land, to givo to the Irish that good beef and mutton and strong beer which their constituents wanted, and to fill their pockets with that ""English gold"" which they had not themselves ! English gold in Irish pockets ! \\hy that would be at once the commenceme11t and the end of the halcyon state of things which Lord G. BEKTINCK anticipated. Having animad­verted with some severity on the extm­ordinary exbibition which he said that Lord G, BENTINCK ba,d made of himself at the close of his speech, he gave notice that if on this occasion the House should depart from thG grand rnle of allowing private enterprise to regulate private capital, he should demand, as scon as any sum was granted to the suffering poor of Ireland, a similar suin for the suffering poor of England ; for it was quit3 eyident that ,ve were fast corning to a grneral scramble for property. The plan of Lord G, B1rnTINCK was either good in ikelf nr it ­was good for the relief of tho existitig distrtss. Lcrd J. Rt ssELL had shown its uselessness for the latter object ; and as to its first object, he would ol:;serve that it was taking an unfair advantage of the present distress of Ireland to press the claims of its landiorcls on the compassion of the people of England. If ever such a bill of appropriation should be brought into Parliament, he certainly would in­troduce a clause into itthat no Irish hnd­lord being a meml:er of thatH,.use should have any sharc> in the spoil. He had the satisfaction of knowing that at a future stage the Crown would refn,e its arnent to certain clauses of this Bill, and that it must in consequence be given up. But why not crush it at once ? Wl at had the House been doing that night for the people of Ireland ? Absolutely nothing. They had wasted three good hours for no other purpose than thnt of giving Lord G. BENTINCK an opportunity of making a great display and a crack speech. The bill was then brought up, read a first time, and ordered to be read a second time on Thursday next.",GOVERNMENT AND IRISH RAILWAYS.,4,2/5/1847
"(LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, F:li:BRUA~Y 5, 1847.) So more, and more still, is demanded demur, but there are occasions when for Ireland. A loan of ±.16,000,000, or good nature gets the start of discrdion, thereabouts, to finish her railways, is and very soon loses its labonr. '1110 asked for. Certainly when the project is magnitude of the project and its very at­put in so specious and pleasant a form as tractiveness enjoin a thorough ,9ifting. it was last night, it may be ill-natured to We are asked to play with great sums, to step into immense undertakings, to inter­fere with grave interests, to show extra­ordinary favour, to establish unusual pre­cedents, to do what we have never done, and what we have mi.de it a most par­ticular point not to do on other not less deserving occasions. As the scheme is pressed with a fervour and popularity -which give some faint indication of eventual success, it is better to discuss its merits in limine, before people have committed themselves too far. In the first place, what is the occasion of this demand 1 The Irish public, with an impetuosity we did our utmost to check, with a slovenliness that charac­terized every stage of their petitions, and with a special indulgence on the part of the Lagislature which we considered any­thing but kindness, have .obtained Acts for railwaj,s amounting to 1,522 miles. Both money and credit are wanting. Though some of these Acts have been passed eleven years, only 123 miles of railway have been completed, and only 164 are in process of completion at the present moment. The "" calls "" are not paid up, and the sl1ares are at a fright­ful discount. The native capitalists are no capitalists at all. The landowners are "" stuck fast."" The directors come to the English market for loans, and find, -somehow, the "" fashion "" against them. They are encountered by a sort of panic, or epidemic of want of confidence in everything Irish. So the "" fix "" is com­plete. Government, therefore, is to set the fashion, restore the confidence, lend the money, finish the railways, change discount into premium, fill the pockets of the shareholders, and perform all thorn other wonders which Harlequin is ex­pected to do on the stage and a Minister in the Emerald Isle. Now, with all due respect to the fashionable '' principle of introducing capital into Ireland,"" we beg to observe that in this part of the empire we usually hold that the facility of ob­taining capital is the chief test of utility, that it is not ultimately advantageous to force a particular improvement much in advance of the general progress, and that a universal want of confidence is commonly too well founded. The moneyed ,men of this country are not so hood­winked by fashion or favouritism ; they are not so ignorant and suspicious as to throw away the real prospect of a good percentage. If Lord GEORGE BEN'l'INCK will prove by figures that the unfinished Irish railways will pay 7 per cent. he will have no need to go to the House. He need only open shop as an Irish share­broker, and the millions will flvw in. But what is the difference between the proposed railways and the new roads now so universally stigmatized as useless, un­productive, and demoralizing ? A rail­way is only a better sort of road, and it is also more expensive. If a road is a work of the "" unproductive.'' class-a point which seems agreed on all sides-so also is a railway. Both are immediately un­productive, both are ultimately protluc­tive if judiciously designed, but other­wise a great waste of money and labour. At least let us take warning by the past, and not pass in a moment from crying down roads to crying up railways. Nor does it follow that because 123 miles of railway in all Ireland pay well, that 1,522 miles will enjoy an equal success. Unfortunately, the favour cannot be shown without a flagrant injustice to many-we had almost said myriads-in this country who deserve favour quite as well. It is true that as far as we know there are not any railways in England now at a stand-still. But the shares of many have fallen to a discount, and the shares of all have fallen very far below the price at which tl;iey were estimated twelvemonths since, and at which they probably came into the !,ands of their present holders. 'fhis fall, too, is owing to the verv same circumstances that have cast down Irish shares-viz., the per­petual "" calls,"" the straitness of the money-market, and the high price of food, The depreciation, as compared with in­trinsic merits and paying power of the Hnes, has been quite as great here as in Ireland. Perhaps the noble author of the present scheme is hardly awar.e of.the extent of the inconvenience, not to say­suffering, caused by this downfall of prices, and the variety of classes affected. Every fresh "" call "" throws down the price of shares, and compels a large pro­portion of the holders to part with them for what they will fetch in the market. The trade of the cou~try is seriously embarrassed by the number of those who are now selling at a loss, or holding on with crippled means. The grant of £16,000,000 to the lines of one province would help to depreciate all the rest. Now, we cannot but think that a very deep and formidable sense of injustice would be generated in the minds of the English shareholders who, in the midst of all their own losses and entanglements, saw the Irish shareholders suddenly lifted up out of the mire, and helped through their difficulties, with full pockets, by a special favour which at the same time gave the coup de grace to their own hopes of returning premiuru. A system of loans which is not equally extended to the whole country is only ""robbing PETER to pay PAUL."" The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER cannot make money or food out of nothing. But what h2.s the favoured class done to deserve this favour ? Or what shculd put one speculation more under national pro­tection than another ? , The present relief it would afford to Ireland is an even more questionable af""air. In cerlain limited locnlities, in the least distressed parts of the island, t,he railroads would employ some 50,000 of the best men-eitter those who were so fortunate :is to be on tho spot or those who could easily seek work on the Scotch and English lines. The employment would not teach agriculture, or manners, or morals. ""Navigators ""seldom return to agricultural labour. That these 50,000 would be better fed for the time, would consume more exciseable commodities, might within the twenty-four hours after rec iving their weekly pay have gold in their pocket, eat beef and mutton, and drink strong beer, is certain enough. But the rest of the empire, from the richest to the poorest, would pay for that dangerous prosperity. The honest and obedient drudges of this island would be removed farther tl1an ever from these unknown, unattainable luxuries. The labourers of Dorsewhire and the opera­tives of Lancashire are already "" paying the piper,"" Every working-man in this islaud his an Irish peasant on his back, and may deem himself only too fortunate if both are not floundering in tho mud before next August. But if these 50,000 able-bodied Irish navigators h11ve no par­ticular claim, no more have the landlords. Give them £170 per acre for their land, -give them their shares at a premium, -what is there to tie the money down to the Irish soil, and stay it from going that road, marked by footsteps all one way, that leads to the den of the devouring absentee ? But why is so serious an innovation on the practice of the empire put forth by itself without any more of the system to which it properly belongs ? Propose a new and peculiar ~ystem for Ireland if you please. Dcclaro the country bank­rupt and incompetent. Supersede pri­vato rights, take cha.rge of all properties, and comprehend all classes within the leading strings of a kind but arbitrary rule. Put young farmers to nurse. TeRch LEIBIG to the poor, and COCKER to the rich. Dispose estates, as CROMWELL and a few others have done, on the principle defor dignicri. Lay out your own lines of railway in a parlour of the Castle ; and when lords creep in by dozens to job, to bully, and to bribe, whip them, and send them to bed. In fact, make Ireland a inodel farm, and its inhabitants children, if you can. There will at leaRt be consistency in the plan. It will be an attempt to govern Ireland. But we de precate applying to it a solitary and in sulated part of the system. If we are to do everything for it, let us at least have something for our pains in the shape of a more efficient control. '.[he assistance Ireland asks will soon amount to the pur­chase-money of the whole island. We are open to an offer. What does Ireland want for herself ? But we protest against a one-side 1 bargain, in which we have nothing to do but to pay.","(LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, F:li:BRUA~Y 5, 1847.)",2,2/5/1847

Once drugged with Hibernian rhetoric, and you find everything growing in your mind to pretorrn,tural dimensions and eternal reality. Should you by happy chance awake from your dream, it will probably occur to you that it is all too good to be true. In this sober island we are accus­tomed to the presence of drawbacks, and we suspect a too unmixed success. By the time, therefore, that the Irish orators have run up their case to tho clouds, and put on tho finishing stone, we find they liavo proved too much. If their case is so good, if their undertakings are so sound, their capabilities so undoubt~d, why do they come before tho nation in the form of Rupplicants? Why is help so importunately demanded for that which is so stn,ng in itself ? The Irish railroads, we are told, will most certainly pay. The proofs are un­deniable. Why, then, are tho shares at so considerable a discount? vVhy is the appeal not made to professional money­lenders, who can unders'.and the subject, instead of to a Parliament of country gentlemen? Mr. HUDSON informed us the other night that a loan of £16,000,000 for Irish railways was the simplest affair in the world ; indeed, that he and the companies under his management only two months since procured £10,000,000. It is obvious to ask him,tisthe bystanders asked the Rhodian braggadocio in the fable, who boasted of his leaps, and was challenged to the proof, Why then don't you raise the £16,000,000 now ? Last night the Marquis of GRANBY informed us, on the authority of "" a gentleman in Ireland,"" that there were a thousand fish­ing bo1ts at Claddagh, in Galway, which wi11 occasionally go out and capture in a day eight million herrings, which, at 10s. a thousand, amount to £4,000 for one day's 'work; but that for want of con­veyance it is impossible to dispos,i of them, and accordingly oven while the shoal is on the she-re the thousand boats only go out one day in four. What in­exhaustible wealth ? The "" goods "" r€1­turns of a railway to Claddagh would beat the London and Birmingham. Pursuing the Marquis's arithmetic, the conveyance of fish from Galway to Dublin, at the moderate charge of 2s. 6d. a thousand, would run up to £6,000 a week. But why is not all this rei;:resoni.ed in the proper qnarler ? Wherever you can po:nt out a good coal field on this island 11'1 r. HUDSON and his friend Mr. STEPHENSON will guarantee a railway t0 that point. A fishery which produces £4,000 is as good as a colliery. If coals are black diamonds, rod herrings are pearls. The same couleur de rcse surrounds every branch of tho argument. Tn England people of the good old schcol, country gentlemen and clergymen, old ladies and amateur statesmen, used to cry down railways as the greatest mischief that could happen to a country. When the railways were finished, and tl1e said old ladies found themselves whirled along t,hirty miles an hour in carriages ten times mere comfortable than their own family coaches, they discovered that railways, like cookery, wore a pleasant resnlt of an unpleasant process. It was tl,e making of railways that did the mischief. 'rhe tumultuous assembhges, t110 mutual fmcouragements to outrage, tbe drinking of beer, the robbing of hon­roosts, the bre;i,king the Sabbath, the poaching, the swearing, the contamina­tion of youthful minds, were now the most offensive pointe. Could a railway be constructed by genii, all would be well. Take railways to Ireland, and all is changed in a moment. 'rhere it is th1c1 making of a railroad that does all the good. The rough prepa,atory process is to regenerate IrelRnd. Navvies and sub­contractors are to be the cbief instru­ments in this great moral work. Under their careful tuition the young men and boys of the localities blessed with an un­finished railway will learn to work hard, to oat, drink, sleep, and blaspheme in gangs. The ultimate advantage of the railway is a secondary affair. The making is the thing. It will do good, not because it will relieve tho destitute, not because it will employ th'.i general class of peasantry, not because it will cheapen provisioJJs, not because it will reproduce food. It will do none of these things, for the present at lea3t. Its one great re­commendation is that it will convert the yonng peasants into railway la.bourorr­fit for that work, and that work alone. Such is the surprising met:i.morphosis a navigator undergoes as soon as ho returns to Irish soil, Tho rough tDn of Con­naught was formidable enough to the weak nerves of English gentility so long as he was wit,hin a mile of the village, the beer-shop, tho barn-yard, , mi the pre­serve. His foot once in Ireland, and he is a missionary of order and prnce. Tho truth is, the scheme comes under tbe category of Irish panaceas. That nation is always looking out for ""god­ sends,"" forgetting that the Giver of all good gifts requires us to seek them by indtistry and prudence. It is the bar­barous old legend of the "" pot of u:uld '' repeated in ten thousand new forms. The £16,000,000 are nothing but a ""pot of gold."" Mr. J. O'CONNELL last night un­reservedly declared himself ready to support any measure whatever that created an expenditure in Ireland. So long as capital was to be introduced, whatever the folly, whatever the waste, tu him it was enough. Sow sovereigns broadcast over Ireland, for a good pur­pose if you can think of one, but for some purpose or other. We can understand buw Mr, J. O'CONNELL may attach even a superstitious value to those bright little counters. But we beg to remind him that "" all is not gold that glistens."" A loan may be sweet in the mouth, but bitter in the stomach. Should England advance these £16,000,000 for railways not ultimately profitable, the result would be to render the British Treasury a great absentee proprietor of Irish rail­ways. While a few paltry thousands were here and there dropping into the hands of the unfortunate shareholders, £560,000 would annually cross the gulf into the all-consuming land of the Saxon. The debt would v-irtually be paid in produce, and Ireland would point to a fresh drain of food from her shores as a proof of England's insatiable greediness and grinding tyranny. But these gentle­men leave others to calculate conse­queuc.;s, They have no scruple in throw- ing upon the public the responsibility of the ,favours they demand from it, The persons who actually bored the Legisla­ture into suspending the standing orders and the usages of Parliament in favour of their railways, and now found upon the concession of that favour a demand for pecuniary assistance, would be quite as ready ~o abuse the Legislature for draw­ing out of Ireland the interest of the national loans to her railways. If the member for Shrewsbury lends his talents to the general delusion, it is a weakness we owe to his political attachments, and the enthusiasm which a man of letters is so apt to feel for whatever affects to be generous. To scatter gold and employ labour, even though the gold is robbed from others and the labour is spent to no purpose, is a noble, if not always a rational, proceeding. He thinks it possible by the introduction of railways to trans­plant bodily as it were a better system into Ireland. To him it is only that figure of speech familiar to scholars, whereby, to a suggestive imagination, a part will sometimes stand for the whole. "" It will,"" he says, ""employ much labour ; it will open markets to fresh fields of industry in every part of Ire­land ; it will create new buildings, new trades, and will give a new impulse to the fisheries ; it will give a new face and character to the country, and, above all, impart a new character to the people and a new tone to the age in which we live. It is beyond all precedent a practical and comprehensive measure."" Would that this were not merely the dream of a warm and creative imagination ! It is no dis­credit to Mr. DISRAELI that he should even overrate that social progress, that moral elevation which the intellect and taste of the age perceive to result from the railway system. When that system demands its historian and its eulogist the hon. member for Shrewsbury will dis­charge tha.t office with the inspiration of earnestness and truth, In his eyes we live, not in an iron, but a 11olden age. But we beg most humbly to prepare him for the disappointment which is so apt to arise when one single eireumstance and means of civilization is pressed on before the rest. Railways are not the only want of Ireland. That country is not so be­hindhand in its communications as it is in most other respects. Its natural means of communication are ur.rivalled. By a strange accident, the proposed railways are generally between places which have already a cheap and easy medium by rivers and seas. But we will not retul'n to consider the practical working of the scheme. It is a matter of feeling with Mr. DISRAELI. He sees in railways only a bit of his own England-England of the 19th century, improving, bustling, in­genious, comfortable, and locomotive. Such is the idol of his patriotism, and we can easily imagine his anxiety to intro­duce the least portion of this leaven into Ireland.",RAILROADS IN IRELAND,2,2/16/1847
"THE IRISH SAVINGS BANKS (LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, MARCH, 4, 1847.) ""JI '1110 n,turns of the Irish savings-banks are, to say the least, a very remarkable fact. We have no wish to press them into the service of any opinion, favour­able or unfavourable, to l;he character of that pwple. This is not the time for such reflections ; but a fact is a fact, and is always worth something, especially when it happens to go rather beyond one's common calculations. Undoubtedly, the thought that would first cross the simple English mind, at the mention of the savings-banks, is that they would exhibit, in due proportion, the drain ou the general resourcls. A famished people one expects to be poor. A popu­lation of eight millions, out of whom three or four are on foe charity list, and a large p'.)rtion of the remainder are said to be actually dying, or dead, in ditches, cannot have much to lay by. They cannot pay rent. They boggle at rates. As for tax.es, they have long been excused that incumbrauce. What can they possibly save 1 A savings-bank in such a situa­tion can be little else than a mockery of woe. lf the poor creatures could live on flints, and sell the skins, there might be a surolus ; but, as it is, one meal per cliem musti un away with all tbeir allowance. These are natural reflections, but it appears they are not founded on a just estimate of the Irish character or circum­stances. \Ve find ourselves forced to confess, what Irish gentlemen are so fond of telling us, that we know nothing about that most unaccountable people. The fact is; the Irish savings-banks never were so prosperous. Leinster, excluding the city of Dubliu itself for the reason ,mentioned in our remarks on the last returu, exhibits a total increase in the deposits on January 11 1847, as compared with that day the previous year, of not J,.ss than £36,000. This would excite no remark in ordinary years. The total deposits in the province on the latest of those dates are £965,315 ; and £36,000 is uot much more than pro­portionate to the usual increase of l,)Opulation. The only remark to be made now is that famine has not affected the savings of the people. In Ulster the increase is greater, the total deposits under the two above mentioned dates being severally £621,338 and £668,787. Even in Oonnaught the deposits have risen from £131,156 to £140,781, though counties of such melancholy notoriety as Mayo, Roscommou, and. Sligo arn in it. In Munster the deposits have imprm ed from £1,045,58! to £1,107,280, aud even at that focus of destitution, Castle Townsend, for the special :relief of which every parish in the empire has been pri­vately, as well as publicly solicited, there has been a most unaccountable rise from £1,571 to £2,651. It is worthy of remark, that the ports exhibit the most striking improvement. Drogheda,. Duudalk, Wex­ford, Belfast, Newry, Sligo, Cork, Water­ford, are among the chief examples of augmented deposits. Limerick, however, stands at the head. There the totals at the two dates are, £167,719 and £189,378 ; the difference m favour of the later date being nearly £23,000. Now, whatever the probable account of this fact, at any rate let it be known. Let all Europe, which watches our domestic affairs with so benevolent a curiosity, take uotice that Ireland, star­ving Ireland, oppressed Irelarn1, at this very acme of her woes, is putting by more money than ever. In France it is not so. There the savings-banks feel and reveal the wants of the people. Yet the de­positors are of much the same class in both places. They who save are not the very poor. They are thrifty, struggling people, either just beginning to rise, and desirous to be at least oue step higher in the world, or equally anxious to secure their present position amid the changes and chances around them. In France, the chief depositors are servants, artizans, small tradesmen, and perhaps a small proportion of farmers. The dearth has drawn out the d~posits of this class. ln Ireland it has increased them. Perhaps the readiest solution is, that in a time of grnat apparent insecurity and general decay, with destitution becoming daily more importunate aud threatening, the great multituc!e of small holders are doing what their ancestors did in time of civil wa.r--hoarding their money. We have alwavs been inclined to look on the savings-bink as a species of hoar,-ing ; a weak resort for thorn who have no l:e1trr use for their money, and by ro men1° a sure indication of prosperity. The Lish farmers are burying their money, not in the ground, but in the bank, to save it from the grasp of famine and the claims of the landlord. In the books of the bank it is safe from charity and rent. Much of it is destined, prob:!.bly, to cross the Atlantic. That any considerable pro­portion of it is directly derived from the "" relief works ""we very much question, though there arc no donbt many thou sands upon the "" relief lists "" who are thereby enabled to husband better their own private means. It is impossible but that out of so many millions rnwn broad­cast over that country some portionshould find its way into the hands of the most industrious and thrifty. '.Ihere is a natural aristocracy in the rude~t and least organized form of society, which governs and taxe3 the rest. 'l'he relief measures themselves establish such a body in the inspectors, paymasters, and other officers. This will help to explain the increased de:r,iosits, though it is impossible entirely to disp,el the disagreeable misgiving that the savings-banks have become, so to speak, the receivers of stolen goods, holding that which was due in law to the landlord, and in mercy to the poor. If we seem to have been touching upon the less admirable points of the Irish character, it will not be out of place to notice anothE>r remarkable fact of an opposite aspect from the above. In our City Article of yesterday we adverted again to the noble exertions made by the Irish emigrants in America for the relief of their friends at home. From the four chief ports of the Union, it appears, they annually transmit for this purporn more than a million dollarR, or upward of £200,000. If to this amount be ad,cled the remittances which everybody knows are continually sent from England and Scotland, and also from the colonies, it will not be thought improbable that the Irish in all parts of the world send home a larger sum than the very paltry amount paid by the landlords under the head of poor-rates.",THE IRISH SAVINGS BANKS,2,3/4/1847
"GENERAL APATHY IN IRELAND. (LEADING ARTICLE, MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1847.) There is one feature of the famine in Ireland which has forcibly impressed itself on the English public, and which we animadvert on now for the benefit of those whom it specially concerns. So B110ckingly prominent is it, that we venture to say it wiH ever be recorded as distinguishing the present from similar calamities. Tho astounding apathy of the Irish themselves to the most horrible scenes immediately under their eyes, and capable of relief by the smallest exertion, is something absolutely without a parallel in the history of civilized nations. All that. we read of in th<cJ description of Turkish or Chinese fatalism, of the in­difference to life on tho banks of the Ganges, or the brutality of piratical tribes, sinks to nothing, taking examples and opportunities into account, compared with the abso!,1te inertia of the Irish in the midet of the most horrif}ing scenes. The Turkish prcdcstinarian sees a fellow­creature struggling for life in tho water, and will not ~ven throw Hm a ropo though it lies at Ins feet. He sees a poor wretch sssaulte<l by 2 s2assins in the street, and clo0 s not even take the pipe from his mouth to lend a hand or rais3 an alarm. We can understand this, 8hocking as it is ; but we cannot understand what ap­pearn to be of daily occurrence in Ireland, and what we have on the authority of persons who srnm to share the general stupidity. We are told by eye witne0ses of scores and hundreds of poor creatures actually dying for want of a meal ; families perish­ing a member a day ; an old woman found half-starved on Monday, dying on Tuesday, dead on Wednesday, unburied on Saturday, half devoured by rats on Monday, dragged along the ground by a dying brother, or roughly carted to the burial-ground, and there laid with not even a sufficient covering of soil. We are told of whole families round dead at a time, in populous neighbourhoods. Churchyards am scraped scarcely deeper than the soil usually is for planting pota­toes,and tho cofl:ins-if coffins tLere are­ Jaid three deep on the surface. :But the na'ii-ete with which the£e horrors are re­lated hy persons perfectly competent to prevent them, is what utterly passes an English apprehension. Informants of all kinds-priests, who pretend to claim the obedience of their flocks-laymen, able, at least, to write a letter to a newspaper and make a speech at n meeting-and clergymen,living in ca,tles and parsouage houses, with hor.;es, sGrvants, and car­riages-tPll us the.ie things v,ith as much composure as they would of a murrain in a rookery, or the destruction of a colony of rats. A letter in the Irish news to-day is only one of many we have inserted with ooual astonishment at the contents. A cEr,-syman at Skibhereen is visited by two gentlemen from Oxford, who brin~ a con­tribution from the University, elicited, like similar contributions from many other places, by the published accounts of Skibb, reen. The money sent to that village in every imaginable way, as national relief money, as part of the public suhscription8, and as more pri­vate collsc ions, has been so considerable as to double the popuhtion by enticing pooc creatures from all parts of the country. This, of course, must increase tho difficulty of the cl?rgy and other al­m01Jers, but it shows how mnch has been done. 'lhis clergyman takes his visitors round to eee the sights of Skibbereen. Awful sights they are ! But, not to speak of tho money that has been sent to this place, the shocking incidents related are such as mere manual help, with a very little food, could have obviated. We refer our reader~ to the letter. Let them judge for themselves. Some days since there was anoth3r case even more extra­ordinary. A clergyman told us oi his drivini in a gig with his servant through his parish, and being directed to a hut wh:0 re a woman had died and had not re­cei1 ed Christian burial. He looks over the garden wall, ,wd sees the corpse, half in tho ground, and torn by dogs, while, a fow yards off, he recognized as her hair what he had mistaken for the tail of a horse. He throws a stone at the dogs, gees home, and writes a letter to the newspaper. If our readers will take notice, they will find that the great bulk of the letters describing the horrible in­cidents of the famine betray the same un­accountable obtnsene,s of feeling and action. People die with money in their pockets because the shop is a few miles off, and nobody will fetch them a meal. A. sort of judicial helplessness interferes at ovary et2ge of the misfortune. The whole population seem jnst a day too late fo, enry net of relief. The food or the coffin is always b-cought twenty-four hours behind tl e time. But that delay is enough to settle the business. Why, what are these people all made of 7 IR Ski b bereen like one of those cities mentioned in Oriental history where the men were all maimed of their hands by some brutal conqueror ? Are they all somnambulists ? Do they see these things waking, or in a dream ? They are not tongue-tied, why then are not their limb« at liberty ? Could these thrngs cccur iu any English parish ? Did they in any of the great plagues of London ? If the like . were hapi;ening anywhne in England, if people were dying a dozen a day, the sur­vivors could not eat, or drink, or sleep till they had laid them decently in consecrated soil. Any English clergyman woulct hire men at once, even if his own children wanted a meal ; or if he had not a shilling to hire a man,would take a spade himself, and dig at least lmlf-a-d01:1en graves, two feet cieep, in a day, and by his example would soon gather a few neighbours who would see the work thoroughly and religioudy done. In all these narratives the same thought will occur to every English mind. How came it to pass that the informant, being on the spot, allowed these horrors to proceed thus far 7 In such cases no cure whatever can ma.ke up for prevention. But the Irish are always for curing, never for pre­venting. By the news of to.day our readers will seo that while the people are allowing coflins to be laid by scores actually on the surface, simply because theywill not be at tho trouble of digging graves, they are presenting thousands of pounds-for what ? For covering tbe churchyards with three f0et thickness of rarth ! Think of that, Englishmen ! 'l'here is the way your money is to be wasted ! In laying coffins on the ground, and then drawing earth at an immense expense to rairn the church yard. Could the bare idea of such folly enter an English mind ? Could anything make it clearer that it is not money, but men that Ireland wants-real men, pos­sessed of average hearts, heads,and hands. Some of our readers, perhars, may ima­gine Skibbereen to be only a.n accumula­tion of miserable objects, containing no class to whom any appeal could b"" made either for pecuniary or bodily assistance. No such thing. The savings-bank at Castle Townsend doubled its deposits last year. In the Union of Skibbereen, besise3 many gentry, who conRider themselves no little people, and who would "" cut '' nimJty-nine hundredths of the subscribers to the Irish destitution funds, there are 2,912 persons holding more than ten and not more than twenty acres ; 2,4'H hold- y 2 ing more than twenty and not more than fifty acres ; 420 holding more than fifty and not more than a hundred acres ; 91 holding more than one hundred and not more than two h,mdred acres ; 13 holding moro than two hundred and not more than five hundred ; and five holding from five hundred to a thousand acres. Is it credible that among all these there was not to be found the money, or the manual strength, for giving decent Christian burial to these poor creatures 1 But the same feature runs through the narratives and the complaints of every other locality. Half the labour that has been lavished in holding meetings to pass resolutions against the Government or in writingscurrilous andfooli~h letters,would havesulllced tosupply food,or,failing that, Christian burial to all the cases of un­doubted starvation. The priests set the example, and they appear to confine themselves entirely to the agreeable task of calumniating the Government and dis­covering in the calamity a new reason for seizing the remnant of property left to the Established Church. Why do they not appeal to the more wealthy of their own flocks 1 They have the best oppor­tunity of knowing the means of the people ; and it is a very great mistake to suppose th,tt the substantial farmers are suffering. On the contrary, to a large proportion ol them the last year was a very good year, and they have added to its natural Jertility an extensively suc­cesEfu! resistance to rents on the plea of distress. On Saturday we gave relnctant inser­ tion to a string of stupid invectives against the Imperial Government, the union, and the cl'lrgy, and, as usual, bringing home every death to the Eng­lishman's door. They were in the shape of resolutions drawn up at Ballinrobe by a meeting of Dr. M'HALE's priests, pre­sided over by a very reverend kinsman of that amiable man. But are there no people in the neighbourhood represented by those clergy to whom they could ap­peal instead of flinging their calumnies across the Channel at a Legislature which has just voted £8,000,000 to the relief of the Irish ? Let us see how the farmers in the union of Ballinrobe stand. There are six persons holding,that is occupying, from a thousand to two thousand acres, 21 from five hundred to a thousand, Ill from two to five hundred, 215 from one to two hundred, 439 from fifty to a hundred, 1,108 from twenty to fifty, and 2,252 from ten to twenty. The Very Rev. Mr. M'HALE knows, as well as we do, that a good many of these farmers are making a very good thing of the famine. Why does he not bestow on them a little of his indignation 1 But what can show more clearly the absolute necessity of 11 law that shall com­pel the richer to relieve the poorer, and so exact those offices of charity which the Roman Catholic priests are evidently un­able or loath to prescribe 7 It is a mis­take to suppose that the Irish farmers are an insolvent class. 'fhey have money, but they hoard it. It is for their own advantage they should be compelled to use it in the employment of labour.",GENERAL APATHY IN IRELAND,2,3/8/1847
"STATE OF SKIBBEREEN. (MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1847.) (FROM THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENT,) DUBLIN, MARCH 5. A letter from tha Rev. Richard Boyle Townsend, dated the 1st of March, gives a harrowing sketch of the destitution that still prev:iils in the doomed district of Skibbereen. It appears that Lord Dufferin and the Hon. Mr. Boyle (brother of Lord Glasgow), l::aving read while in Oxford some of Tu<~r Townsend's statements, made a collection in that city, and came over to Ireland, in order to witness in person the scenes of misery described in the public journals. .Arrived in Skibbereen, the noble Lord and his companion waited on Mr. Townsend, ;vho acted as their guide in an excursion through the town and suburbs. The rev. gentleman's narrative proceeds as follows :­ "" I carried them to one of our cabins, the best of its kind. I took them there, supposing it free from disease ; hut the only inmate then within told us she was af­fected with <liarrhcea.. They were shocked. We went from this to the old church­yard. There they saw the mode of sepul­ture now common, of throwing the bodies out of a shell coffin into a pit, and cover­ing them so slightly that a few scrapes of a shovel soon laid bare the abdomen of one that was the uppermost. You may be sure this sufficed for so far. We passed thence to the place occupied by their more fortunate fellow-sufferers from the workhouse. Them had coffins. They were, bowever, scarcely C'.lVered, and the ends of tvrn of one tiu of coffins (for there are three placed one over anotlrnr in a grave about two feet deep. and the upper one comes level with the sur­face) were exposed, There was a pit in pr0gress of being tilled by bodies from the rnme lwuse at the feet of these, and I asked why it was left in that uncovered, unmacle state. Tlie men employed digging a lengthened pit said that the persons employed by the workhouse authorities had hr ught four bodies as yet, and, as t.hey expected six more that evening,they left the pit unfinished. His Lordship never saw such a sight before.' ' They had buried six tha prnceding morning from the-workhouse, and four more in the even­ing""of the same day. And they are in the habit of bringing some days 11 bodies ti be thus interred.' Such was the information given by those disinterested workmen. We left this, only to be witnESses of a scene which, while it baffies description, shows powerfully the terrible effect such a state of things as ours is producing on a people not previously brutalize<""'. ! At the end of what is called the New­bridge, there is a miserable shed at the gable-end of as miserable a cabin. The parish coffin arrived just as we reached the end of the bridge. I begged his Lords ship to sbnd and see. The men standing by begged we might move off. But we had cowe to see. The coffin was bken from the cart-its very size, to fit all dimensions of persons, is in itself calcu­ lated to strike with horror. It was brought to the door. It was too large for this to admit it. One of tho fellows began to blaspheme and curse at others not disposed to do his work. They went iu, and after some minutes' rummaging amongst her dying family of four which she had left, they brought out the naked and emaciated skeleton of an old woman -a mere little torn remnant of what had once been a quilt being just thrown over the abdomen. One took her by the head and the other by the heels and flung her into the coffin, making some shocking ex­ clamation ! It was too much. We turned from the sight completely sickened, and his Lordship made up his mind that ' he had seen enough. He would not call on the doctor,' with whom he was to go round the next day. He had determined to stay the next dav to see all thfl multitudinous effects of our terrible famine. He could look on no more. He went off next day. In ad­ dition to the £50 he had collected in Oxford, he gave £10 in remem­ brance of the scenes he had witnessed. The poor old woman's shattered frame he never forgot the whole evening. And, to say truth, when I returned I could eat no dinner. I tried to eat, but could not. His Lordship did not know how I could stand such scenes and sights. God knows, nothing but a stem sense of duty' detains me here ; for we cannot, with all we get, do more than give a taste--we have not enough to feed tho creatures---victims of a most mistaken national policy, on whom the principles of politi.eal economy have been carried out in practice to a mur­ derous extent."" ;",STATE OF SKIBBEREEN,1,3/8/1847

In \vhat sense is Ireland poor '/ Is i\ so poor as to produce very little, and that with great difficulty J Is it nnimprov,1ble I Is the soil ungrate­ful ? With tho present amount of labour spent uron itI does it yield no super­abundance for exportation ? Poor as Ire­land is, all these questions must be answero:1 in the negative. What was Lord GEORGE BENTINcK'S reCBipt for the £amino as s ;on tts it appeared in good earnest, nnd could no longer be called a Tamworth lie ? He discovered that Ire­land annually exported enough of corn alone to supply the whole deficiency of the potatc crop. "" Let it keep those three millions of quarters at homo,and they will feed, rit short commons, and with a little else to help, five millions of people."" This was his advice, to the best of our recollection, and very fair advice as re­garded the end, though the way and means were not very clear. We cherish the memory of that suggest on, impracticable, almost to the verge of mockery, as it wrrs. It recognized a great principle-the lien thitt poverty has on the produce of the land. Evon to the inconvenience of thoE,e who had been accustomed to depend on that supply, and had nude all their arrangements accordingly, Lord GEORGE was for putting an embargo on the corn at the Irish ports, and sending it back to the famished children of tho soil. Thtit suggestion also gives a fortunate prominence to the fact that there is that quantity of corn, the fo:id of three mil­lions, annually sent ont of the island. Nor is that all. The other exports of food -of cattle,pigs,beef,perk, butter, cheese, lard, eggs, 11nd other nutrit.ions commo­dities are on the same exc~rnin, scale. "" Poor Ir,Jand'' exports DL re fcod than any other country in the whole world­not merely more in proportion to its people, or its area, but aboolutely more. Its exports of food are greater than these of the united Stdes, or of Hussi:J,, v,rnt and inexhaustible as we are apt to t,hink the resources of those countries. ::Cuch a fact as this is very compatible ,,ith a people being poor ; but it at least sh)WS that one ought to inquire what sort of a poverty it is. A nation of sbve3 or of helots may be poor, and worse than poor, and yet enrich the world. Cotton, sugar, spices, gold, silver, diamond,, and pel1rls are, with few exceptions, the produce of slaves. Some of the most celebrn.tod granaries of the world, such as Sicily, Pontus, and Egvpt have been the scenes of the most flagrant opprernion. In r,1 these cases the people are poor, thb countries are poor, but the poverty is not the poverty of mi,ture ; it is rather a social than a physical defect. Stand on the quays of Ireland and see the full­freighted vessels leaving her noble rivers and coves. You will there see that so far from Ireland being utterly, radically, and incurably poor, barren, and unprofit­able, she is one of the great feeders of this populous isbnd ; nay, its chief pur­veyor. It is true, that several portions of this island might be taken, which out of a very much less area contribute to the wants of the adjacent districts even a greater amount of rnsternmce. But that is hardly a fair eompt1rison. Ireland does this out of her poverty, besides feeding, after a manner, an immense population. It is this that adds so pain­ful an interest to her miserable state­that she should "" make many rich,"" and yet remain herself 110 poor, and be the author of an abundance which sl1e is not permitted herself to enjoy. It is very clear, then, that the p'.werty ?f Ireland is not irremediable. Lord ctEORGE BENTINCK has given us some clue to a remedy. This drain of food must be first stanch8d. Bnt in order to that it is necessary to ask who it is that sucks aud exhaustJ tho life blood of the island 'I Who i3 the exactor of this fab,l tribute 7 Does it go to pay deht, or rent, or tax, or the price of equivalent imports? They who aro pleased to represent Ireland as the victim of an Imperial oppression will be apt to im2gine that the State, the tax­gathorer, is the master drain. On the contrary, tho State drnws nothing from Ireland. As far as regards her public expenditure, Ireland bas all the advan­bges, aud more than the advantages, of an independent kingdom. Great Britain not only draws nothing from the Irish Trea,ury, but gives Ireland the gratuitous benefit of her o,vn enormous revenue, both in respect of hu colonial em­pire, besides other common advan­tages, and also in extensive gnnts and advances for the peculiar relief and im­provement of Ireland. The whole of the Irish revenue, in­cluding every sixpc:ncu obtained for customs, excise, stamps, and postage-­from tea, sug2,r, coffee, tobacco, spirits, and from every other article imported or miinufactured in tho island, is spent in Ireland itself. Not one Eixponco is re­mitted to tho British Exchequer. That taxation cannot be called heavy or oppres­Jive which is levied almost exclmively on luxuries, and not in all cases a3 hi""'h even on them as in the rest of the e~pire ; while Ireland i.s excmed, with what we think an ill-judged kindness, from many English taxes. This light taxation is all refunded on frish soil. Wo repeat for the information of per~ons who probably never saw or hearc1 of the figures of the question, that Ireland pays not one six­pence to the British-that is, the Imperial Excher1uer. In tho year ending January 5, 1845, the total expenditure out of the revem1A of Ireland was £4,197,482. 0£ this £564,137 was for payments out of tte income in its pro6ress to the Exchequer for charges of collection, and other pay­ments ; £1,395,127 was for the dividend, inter2st, and management of the public funded debt payable in Ireland; £585,350 for other permanent payments out of the Consolidated Fund ; £1,183,780 for the army in Ireland ; £93,460 for the Ord­nance ; £373,527 for miscellaneous pay­ments ; and in the place of the gradually diminishing sum which in previous years had been applied to the reduction of the Nittional Debt and remittances to the British Exchequer, the return for that year was nil. In point of fact the currenf had already set in from the British to the Irish Treasury. The "" advances "" are not reckoned in this statement, and the balance due on them to the Consoli­dated Fund at January 5, 1845, already amounted to £1,235,822. SincG that d,iy it is unnecessarv to sav that Ireland has contributed to the ""British Treasury nothing but an enormous loss ; nor is there the least likelihood of any other kind of contribution for many a year to come. Ireland, thM, is at the samo time rich and poor. It produces a vast superabun­dance of food, but that food is drained fro1h its shores. It is not, however, drained by the State. It is drained, in a great measure, by the landlor@ls and their creditors, who, tbe more they can get, the more they will drain. Now, what does mercy to Ireland require under these cir­cumstances ? Is it mercy to let the land­lord go on, drain, drain, drain, for ever 1 Is it mercy to let him go on squeezing the hapless peasant down to the 5kin of his potato ? Is it of any um-has it been of any use, to remit rates and taxes, and lend money to the landlor<ls ? No. The only mercy is to keep int.he island, and upon the spot, the gracious gifts of PROVI­DENCE and rewards of human toil, and to compel the landowner to spend them in the em;:loyrnent of the labourer and ths relief of the poor.",PLEAS AGAINST A POOR LAW,2,3/12/1847
"THE POOR RELIEF BILL. (DE:BATE IN PARLIAMENT, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1847.) In the Honse of Commons, on the state the recent proceedings of the Government with respect to the cala­question that the SPEAKER do now leave mitous state of affairs in Ireland, and tothe chair for the committee on the Poor call attention to one or two of the pro­ Reliei (Irebnd)Bill. visions of the Bill then before the '.House. Lord J. RussELL declared his wish to In the present condition of public affairs, when clouds and darkness rested on Ire­land, and when many perils were before the House, it was only right that he should make the House acquainted with the steps which Government had taken from time to time to relieve distress, and als:i with the measures which, if carried, must exercise a serious influence on the destiny of not merely Ireland but of England also. Having entered at con­siderable length into the reasons which had induced the Government to adopt some propositions and to reject others, and having given the House a history of the operation of the various legislative measures which had been passed with the view of providing food and employment for the people of Ireland, heturned to the consideration of the Poor Law Bill, on which it was necessary for him to address the House at some length in consequence of a representation that had recently been made to him by 64 peers and 23 members of that House well acquainted and bng conversant with the condition of Ireland. Ha could not consent to the reasons which they had urged upon him with a view of inducing him to give up thoee provisions of the Bill which afforded out-door relief to the able-bodied labourer when in desti­tution ; and, above all, he diff2red from their assertion that the experience of the last 12 months was conclusive against the plan of Poor Law relief which he was now proposing. He pointed out the difference between the relief now afforded on_public works in Ireland, mid the relief to be given hereafter, m and out of the Irish workhouses, and showed that there was nothing in the Bill which made the relief to be given to the able-bodied labourer of Ireland gratuitous relief. In England, when the workhouse was full and relief was given out of the work­hous9, labour was given as a test of desti­tution, and he proposed that a similar plan should be adopted in Ireland. Ad­mitting, however, to these noblemen and gentlemen, that it might be very difficult to prevent out door relief from being a<i ­c0mpanied with abuses, he asked them, since they objected so strongly to his pro­positfon, whether they had any plan to propose as a substitute for it, and, if they had, to explain it to him in detail. He repeated to them in public the question which he bad asked in private, and hoped that he should be more successful now than he had been then in obtaining an answer. He admitted tlmt there was much of charity in Ireland ; but it was not the charity of the rich to the poor, but the charity of the poor to the very poor. Until the passing of the Poor Law Act, which he bad first introduced into Ireland, and which lrn now asked leave to extend, he did not think that there was any burden imposed, on either the resi­dent or absentee landlord of Ireland, ex­cept the optional burden arising from the calls of private charity, and that wiis easily avoided. Considering, then, that the destitute in Ireland who were not in the workhouses had hitherto been sup­ported by the voluntary charity of the middle and still more by that of the lower classe~, he saw no other mode of supporting them in future, when the con­dition of Irdaud would be entirely changed in consequence of the diminished cultivation of the potato by tl:e small owners, than by adopting the Bill which he now recommended to the House. In making that announcement, he thought that he could snpport it on grounds per­fectly plain and intelligible. What he now proposed as a permane1,t Poor Law for Ireland had been found in England to be p,rfectly consistent with tte wealth, security, and pro0 perity of the country. Let no one talk to him of tbe abu~es of the Poor Law ; for we bad reformed them in England ; and yet in the last ten years we had spent £-49,000.000 in support of the poor. He contended that it was good economy to lay out such a sum for such a purp0se. He showed tbe mode in which the English Poor Law had met the destitution d tlrn year 1840, when .there was a greater want than or­dinary of food and employment for the poor of England ; and he now proposed that in Ireland, in future, when there was a deficient, instead of an average, harvest, the snme mode and nature of relief should be applied to that country;. He admitted that the present calamity of Ireland was so ovBrwhclming that no Poor Law would have br-cn al.>19 fully to meet its emergency. Most unfortunately for Ireland, by tho connivance of land­lords, tenants, and labourers, there had grown up on its soil a miserable cottier population, and an immense army of mendicants, whose numbers and condi­tion had been frequently portrayed to the House. Such being the case, he did not imagine that such a calamity as the present conld have been met by the gt ntry and farm,-rs of Ireland. Though many of the resident gentry had nobly performed thdr duty, he must say, speak­ing of them as a body, that tho exertions of property in Ireland at the present c: isis had not boen so great as they onght to have been. He thought that among ihe resident landlords thcr<3 were many who ougbtt0 go further t],an H ey had yet gone in C3ntt-ibuti ,nto relief of distre,s und in abstinence from luxury, and that was an arrditiorm.I reason why he should not leave the destitute poor of -that country any longer to the mere hazarcl of being re!bved, He had bern told that in somo parts of Ireland the p'.lpulation was so gnat, and the property ~o inadequa.te to its snpJt_ort, that property must inevitably break down under the operation of this Bill. He d:d not believe the assertion. He admitted that his proYision for the pour might tako a large prorortion of the rental now obtained ; but that certainly was not the case at present. In lfnglaud the average rate levied for the relief of the poor amounted to ls. 7¼d, in the pound upon the rental ; but in Ireland it did not exceed 5ld, H3 did not rnentfon this as a reproaeh to the propridors of Ireland-for they had done all that was required of them by law-but as a proof that there was property in Ireland on which Government could call for a larger as3essment than that paid at present to the relief of the poor. Evuy one lrnd been shocked by the number of deaths which had occurred in the union of Skib­bereon, and by the miserable condition of its surviving inhabitants. Now, the pro­perty of that union was estimated to the rates at £8,000 a-year; but its real annual value was not leJJs than £100,000 a-year. The poor-rate there was 6d. in the pound. It had been raised, it was true, in Novem­ber last to 9d. ; but that rate had never been levied, He mentioned this circum­stance as a proof that there had not been in Ireland that proper assessment and levy of the rates for the relief of tho poor which circumstances required ; and that was another justification for this Bill. He believed that it would induce the landlords and farmers of Ireland to give more employment than at present ; for when they found that the labourer must be supported either while ho was doing work useful to themselves, or while he was doing work of no use to them at all, they would prefer to support him in the first state rather than in the latter. He then proceeded to defrnd that clause of the Bill by which it is provided that one­half of the Board of Guardians should be formed of magistrates Leing ex officio guardians. He consider: d that the dis­satisfaction which that d,mse had excited in Ireland must have arisen from the belief that the magistraksof that country were hostile to the religious feelings and prejudices of the gr2at bulk of the popu­lation. Now, if the magistrates were always to be 0onsider2d by the farmers and lahourErEI of Ireland as their enemies, he should be afraid of placing in the Board of Guardians an equal body of farmers and magistrat€S, But we were on the eve of great changes in Ireland ; and he believed that we were now in a course of transition to those times when all the Irish would act willingly together for the benefit of their common country, and would credit his assertion that in England there was no wish to debar them from any privilege or object of ambition which was naturally their due. He hoped that in these Boards of Guardians we should sse Protestants and Roman Catho­lics, '.l.'ories, Whigs, Radicals, and Re­pealers, differing as they did in religious faith and political opinions, blending1 nevertheless, in social harmony, and acting together in administering justice, in conducting pubJ.ic works, in superin­tending agricultural improvements, and in relieving the destitute, as became the inhabitants of the same country. It was with this view, and not with any inten­tion of giving any supremacy to the @ officio magistrates, thatho had introduced this clause into the Bill, In reply to the statement that there were leading Irish proprietors in the Cabinet who might in­fluence its decisions on this subject favounb,ly to tho rights of property and unfavourably to those of the poor, he remarked that those members of the Cabinet were parties with him in thepro­position of this measure. If it imposed burdens on the land of Ireland, theJ were willing to bear their share of it, and it was with their sanction that he moved that the House do now resolve itself into committee on tho Poor Relief (Ireland)Bill,",THE POOR RELIEF BILL,4,3/13/1847
"(LEADING ARTICLE, SATURDAY, MARCH 13, 1847.) Lord JOHN RussELL does not at all overstate the difficulty of his path when he says that clouds and darkness rest over Ireland, and legislation is beset with perils. Often and often as statesmen may have thought that they ha<l come to the bottom , of Irish distress, no one can deny that a worse than all has arrived, and, moreover, that a worse still remains. The half of the populous island, usually verging on famine, now actually suffers that dreadful extremity ; nor is there any appearance of early relief. The usual food of the people has perished, and threatens not to return for a period far beyond the calculations of man. The only storehouse to which the public pur­veyor can look for relief is that natural magazine created by the industry of the people, over and above their own simple wants, and usually reserved for the pay­ment of rent and other outgoings ; and the supplies providently arriving from distant shores. The former of these is that which common sense and economy would teach us most to depend upon. But here is the difficulty. To arrest that nourishing and fertilizing stream in its course, to detain it on the spot, to con­vert it into the relief of distress, the wages of labour, and the material of re­production, is at least an apparent and possible loss to those who have hitherto exacted, wasted, or alienated this store. Hence a serious struggle between the rights of the many and the rights of the few -between starving peasants and straitened proprietors-between famine and pestilence on the one hand, and decay of fortune and position on the other. Such are the perilous alternatives before the House ; such the clouds and darkness over Irish affairs. . For our own part, we do not hesitate to avow, as we have ever avowed on Jimilli.r occasions, that at such a crisis the few must give way to the many, the part to the whole. While we most thoroughly, ,.Pd at the same time most gladly, believe /\hat the proprietors exaggerate the sacri­;tices demanded at their hands, we assert with all boldness that 1and was created for man, and not man for land ; that ,landlords are made for the people, and ,their peculiar interests are only minis­terial and subordinate to the good of the whole. A general in the field must fay hold of the stores that he finds, and devote them in the first in;ihnce to that purpose which he is bound to consider a paramount object-the maintenance of his army. The compensation he may think proper to afford to tl:e owners is another anJ a secondary question. vVhat is Lord JOHN Russ11LL but our com­mander-in-chief in an unexampled cam­paign ;-Ireland the field, famine the foe, and the army a vast population, without magazines, order, material, or, in a word, any other resource than tho boldness and skill of their chief l The necessity of tbe orisis admits not the usages, or rather the abuses, of peace. If au evil custom has deprived the labourer of his hire,this is just the time to found a more equitable system. Labour and wages, population and wealth, have suffered a long divorce, and must now be reconciled. Grant that the change -is great, and what a man would not willingly undertake ; it is forced on the ,Legislature. Society is reconstructed in disaster ; each new birth is in throes, and institutions are the monuments of wrong. In "" clouds and darkness "" it is necE.ssary to ~ak) a short and simple rule, the guidance cf some great moral truth. The first law of uature, that tho people must be fed, and that more particularly from the work of their hands, is the clue of this labyrinth. In the public weal an enlightened statesman will discern the cloud by day and the piUar of fire by night through this terrible wilderness ; and public weal is an euipty name unless it includes the relief of those who are ready to perish, and the employment of those who are able to work, but have not the oppor­tunity. 'fhe Minister takes an unassailable position when he rests the new Irish Relief Bill on the new facts of the case He is entitled to call it the child of neces­sity. It is contrary to the theories of his Jess experienced age -and less fearful times. Ireland has undergone a virtual revolution. The food of independent poverty has failed. The spontaneous charity of the lower classes has been.ex­hausted. The armies of mendicancy have been destroyed or disbanded. All that miserable syatem, which was rather an apoiogy for society than a civilized society itself, has fallen to the ground. Poli­ticians held it up as long as they could. Secretaries of State found it convenient, and eulogized the noble and trustworthy custom of a perpetual inbreeding beggary. The right of preying on the infant re­sources of rising enteri::rise, and blighting the first bloom of prosperity, .was cried Ill) as a sacred and infalliblorefuge, which it would have beeu impious to supplant with the coarse expedient of a poor's-rate. All that is passed. PROVIDENCE, not man, has put an end to tl1at folly. 1he cottier remains without a crop ; the beggar without a dole. A physical revolution has overthrown the reign of mendicancy and conacre. There is no possible, no conceivable alternative, but to create another system on the ruins, or, rnther, in the place of the old. Time is the greatest innovater, and we only submit to his laws when we erect a new system on a new foundation-that is, the present facts of the case. Without a real Poor Law, offering relief to the destitute and employment to the idle, how are we to meet the new phenomenon of a people in the midst of comparative abundance, but deprived of their wonted food ; paying rent, but without a maintenanc,J ; de­pending on a root that will not thrive, or on neighbours that cannot give 1 A grettt crisis justifies and demands "" a great. experiment.""

"THE DAY OF NATIONAL HUMILIATION. (LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, MARCH 26, 1847.) The cloud is thickening. We are just fresh from a profound acknowledgment of national demerits andan earnest depre­cation of national sufferings. As a people we have deplored our general shortcom­ings. We have expressed our sense of the share that we have had in provoking inflictions, which we have made our own by sympathy. We have made no distinc­tion between Celt and Saxon. We have confessed English and Irish misdeeds or omissions to be alike worthy of punish­ment. Our humiliation has r_epudiated the sectarianism of caste ; our prostration was that of the whole empire, not of a portion ; of a people, not of a pro­vince. But, while our language . has shown that we did not disavow our share in the guilt which has drawn down these cala­mities, and our actions have proved our willingness to alleviate them, we have never, even in our bitterest self-reproach or our most extravagant prodigality, claimed a monopoly either of the crime or its atonement. We have taken to our­selves our just burden, and more than our just burden. But we have never said that it ought to be wholly and only ours. We have called on our Irish.fellow­subjects to bear some partin the cost and consequences of a calamity which we niight have thrqwn almost entirely upon them. A higher sentiment has dictated a more generous policy. But it will require something more cheering than present events to demonstrate that a generous policy is a wise one. While we write, the useleesness-the worse than uselessness-of our past efforts glares painfully upon us. The voice of peni, tential prayer has ecarcely ceased to echo in our churches, when we awake to the prospect of evils even greater than those which we have passed. We have done, as a people, all _that the most exacting foe or the most Jealous rival could have imposed on our submission or onr con­science, In every city of the kingdom, in every village, are seen signs of volun­tary privation and self-denial. Our play­houses, our concerts, our music-rooms, our schools, no less than our churches and public meetings,have been the arena of an unselfish luxury, and a merciful enjoy­ment. The stage has borne its votive tribute to a more imperious cause than any that has yet hallowE:d the sombre pall of tragedy. The ""poor Irish,"" the "" Irish famine,"" :the "" Irish relief fund,"" have all become. household words, preg­nant with a mighty meaning and fruitful of a noble prodigality. No Ministerial tax, no autocratic ukase, could have wrung from the nation more than has gushed forth from the kindly heartiness of the young, the :poor, and the obscure, as well as of the rich and the distin, guished, not only through the open channels of public subscription, but also through the m7.riad streams of small an«! humble contributions. And yet, after all that v;e have done, in what condition :i.s Ireland ? Why do we state these things ? Why do we harp on them as grievancrn ? Do we brag in empty vaunt of a charity made necessary by a crisis ? or do we repine that the heart of benevolence was not hardened, and its arm paralyzed, when the cloud first gathered and the plague first threatened the laud ? GoD forbid ! No such thing. Were it just and needful that this, or rnure than this, should be done by hngland, wa know it would be, and wo should rejoice to see it done. All this, and ten times as much as this, would be achieved by the charity of England, were it absolutely needful that England should tako trw work upon her­self. Comforts wou'.<l be generally denied, luxuries would be universally abandoned, equipages laid down, est<1blishments dis­b:l,l1ded, ev, ry S'cheme, that a generous economy could devise earnestly embraced, every ass2ssmu1t with which a b)untiful opulence could tax its own sup3rfluities would be rigidly enforced, if no other human means wuo discerned for miti­gating an e,normons calamity. But this would be the condition indispensably pre­cedent to such wholcsaie alni""s. All other methods should have been tried ; all other exertions exhausted. The uff..icted country shuuld have helped to work out its own redemption, ere it reposed iircon­fident security on the vicarious activity of its wealthier neighbour. It is because thia has not been done .that we repine ; and not only this, but because the in­activity which shocks us is. so hugely out of proportion to the deman<ls of the time-so monstrously inconsistent with the details of suffering and the clamours for help-so hideously irreconcilable with all pretensions to the barest notion of social obligations-so repulsive in its present form, so dreadful in all that it heralds. It is not simply the inertness of Eastern submission, at once conteut and superstitious, shrinking from exertion both because it might offend the Deity, and because the iils which it might alle­viate had been made tolerable by habit. It is a crafty, a calculating, and a covetous MJ.oness ; an abstinence frqm work, but not from the wages of work ; a specula­tive confidence in the assistance of others, joined to a thorough repudiation of -all self-exertion. The gloom of the winter has passed away, a. winter that will never be for­gotten by this genera.tion ! The season llas c.:omo when not only tho herb of tho field should shoot forth, and the tree should bl0ssom, but the hopes of man also bring forth their fruits. But in Ire­land, alas ! the voice of Natnre strikes upon listless ears and sluggish hearts. In vain has spring returned to men of idle hands and nerveless purpose. In vain has the iron tongue of experience spoken its warning to men who hug their indolent misery as a trnasure, far more precious than the wages of unaided industry. They have tasted of public money, <tnd they find it pleasant~r to live on alms than on labour. The alternative raises no feelings of shame or self-abasement. Deep, indeed, has the cauktr eaten ; not into the core of a precarkus and suspected root, but into the vary hearts of the people, corrupting them with a fatal lethargy, and debasing them by a fatuous dependence ! Not the subsistence of the year alone, but the hope of many years is at stake ; the honour, the industry, and the independence of a rni'!lion of men ! The time for sowing iho seed is come, but no seed is sown. Tho man who has dawdled on tho public works will not toil on tl:e private farm. Tho farmer who has received is unwilling to disburse money. The landholder who will get no spring rent has a good excus'.l for not hiring labourers. And the priest, dependent on all, encourages all in their eomplaints and clamours ! So closely intertwined are the variou~ combinations of Irish non­feasance and mis-feasance ! The farmer backs the labourer in his idleness, and both protect the landlord in his neglect. The Government must do all ! It has fed the peopie through one famine, why should it not bear the expense of a second ? Thus the plough rusts, the spade lies idle and the fields fallow. The worst symptoms of war desecrate the meridian of peace:­ "" Squalent abductis arva colonis."" The Government Inspector in the King's County writes thus :­ "" I have been ci:edihly informed, from various quarters, that the class of small farmers, hoiders of from 25 to 30 acres of land, have Sf'creted l:icth monoy and seed amply imfilciont for their hokli11gs ; but these men arG doing abRolntely nothing, under the impression that the Government will eventnally prepare their land and give them seed for it, rather than see it uncropped.. This opinion pervades most classes, but particnhrly the ono above-mentic,nE,ld ; and it is worthy of noto, thatthi>J class (generally speaking)bas not contribhted one sl1illing to the relief funds, but have dismissed the one or two farm nervants they usually kept, and in not a few instances have got their sollfl on the public works, to the exclusion of the wholly destitute work­man."" The following install<m, given by Cap­tain FISHBOURNE, writing to .Mr. TREVEL­YAN, shows the ruir-ous effect of Govern­mental assistance on a people whose natural temperament disinclines them to help themselvt:s, as well as the cunning which they enlist in support of their de­liberate and darling indolence :~ . "" The difficulties encounteredare incal­culable. I may mention a fuct, rart of which I mentioned when I last wrote, which will serve to show the unreas ,nable­ness or wickedness which is abroad. Mr. Thomas Mahon, owner of some property near Quin, in this county, being told by his tenants that they had no seed, pur­-chased 800 stoue of sead wheat, with the intention of giving it to them ; but, doubting their integrity of purpose, he h_ad it steeped in a solution of sulphate of iron, and then announced that they might have it, but they, tinding that they could not eat it, would not take a grain. He then asked them to let him have the land, and he would sow it .md give them the balance, after deducting the expense of seed <1nd sowing ; they refused this also. Mr. Mahon is a man of the most undoubted integrity, so they never could have doubted for a moment the honesty of his prdessions. I am convinced that they have the seed, and that they will eventually sow the land themselves, or that they have entered into a combina­tion not to sow ; this, I am told, has been done in this county, in the barony of Corcomroe."" What will they next insist on ?

And as ,mder cover of winch England, we are there is no knowing what our position sorry to say, is said to have played the might be if the union were to be repealed part of a scurvy insolvent. It is thidest by either country, it is just as well to of a well c~nceived romance that it in-square accounts no1V, that we mav not be frightened hereafter by the items of the bill against us. l acts are provertially stubborn ; and there is no stouter foe to figures of rhetoric than figures of arith­metic. With every disposition in the world to take the ipsi dix~runt of Con­ciliation-hall financiers, we feel ourselves bound, in the first instance, to apply to our old frieuds the first two rules in COCKER. If they disprove, not even the a-0count books of Burghqnay can convince us. Now, it appears on reference to Treasury papers, published by order of the Rouse of Commons, that on the 1st of I<,ebruary, 1817, the funded debt of Ireland amounted to something n1ore than £130,500,0u0. By the contract of incor­poration with England this debt, in­cluding the one funded in Great Britain, and the other fundAd in Ireland, was transferred to the British Exchequu in that year, and the interest due on this capital has been charged thereon ever since. This at the present time amounts t) about four millions a-year. It is n')torious that a stock grievance of the Repe1tlers has besn what they c,tll the unfair apportionment of the national debt between the two countri s. "" Itis true,"" they say, "" that England took upon her­self the Irish debt ; bu~ she did it in this fashion,-whi-lst she took her sh11re of the £130,000,000, and the annual in­terrnt upon it, she threw upon Irel11nd a moiety of her own £800,000,000, and the annual interest upon that ; so that Ire­land has exchanged the sole payment of £4,000,000 a-year for a participation in the payment of £27,000,000 a-year, and a redeemable debt of £140,000,000 for an unredeemable one :>f £800,000,000 !"" A11d this is universally believed in Ire­land, where, of course, England is looked i1pon as a very artful dodger for having "" done "" the sister-country. We need scarcely say that, e.xcept for claptrap or Repeal purposes, we have no right to this natioual compliment. We have gained nothing at all by this consolidation of the exchequers. Nor has Ireland lost any­thing by it. It is all the other way. Whatever hypothetical grievance or honorary distinction Ireland may claim as jointly-interested in the Imperial debt, she has suffered no practical wrong what­ever by it ; for she has little ,beyond her debts to contribute. She was always in this predicament : she must either dis­charge the current exrenses of the year, and forego to pay the interestof her debt, or else pay the interest of her debt and throw the burden of her expenses on the Imperial Treasury. As the amount of the former has generally been about equal to her revenue, she has been in debted to England for defraying the latter. The following synopsis represents the relation borne by her income to the annual charge of her debt, and the cost of her Government from 1817 to 1820, and again from 1840 to 1846 inclusive :­ I t ~ t t k k k ~ ~ ~ ~ Annual Charge of l -:i -:i en e> m co co o N wc1;i Intere...:t on_ the fi'unded ....::i ~~~.~~~t::~~{::,t: Debtoflreiand, g; &; ff; ~ ~ ffi ~ ru: ~ t3 :=: (as per account No. 4.) r,.:, N N N r-.:i N' -:i CD u, en_ \Deficiency of lnootne l',) 1g t-.:> U1 en ..__, ~ en O W i--a 00 paidinto the bxehe111""er So f:1 ~ ~;;; ~ ~ ~~ J:8 J;; Jgtt: inlrelandtomeetLe ~ ~ ~ g g: t;, ~ ~ ~ @ ~ Annual Cbargt} of , o:o N c.n o .... ev en co (0 w ..... lqtere9t _on tbe Debt.: In the first four years the income falls considerably short of the interest of the debt, ar:d is below the joint demands of the debt and the expenditure by several millions.

The deficiency in both casos fs made good by the Imperial Treasury­that is, by the tax-}.layers of England and Scotland. And this is what the genius of Irish romance, elaberating a grieva.nce, gravely calls saddling Ireland with the debts of England ! England pays the £4,000,000 odd which is annually raised from Irefand to the Irish fupdholder, and then out of her own pocket defrays the charges of hor8e, foot,artillery; civil list, civil engineers, and public works, necessary for the'' tranquillity of the country."" Yet every Irishman is invited t:i believe that he is cheated by the arrangement, and that it would be far better for himself to go on blundering with a deficient revenue which he was always anticipating, and fresh liabilites which he never discharged! These accounts, of course, do not in­ elude the advances made during this year of Governmental prodigality. But, viewed by themselves, they give the unbiased speculator a fair notion of the pecuniary advantages which this country possessesin her Irish resources, at the eame time that tliey furnish an interpretation to the Irish theory of debtor and creditor. Now, too, that we have undertaken the further charge of the Irish police, it must by parity of construction be inferred that we are more in their debt than ever ; and the public works have given them a lien on us for generations to come ! Heltven knows, we wish that it were possible for us to become their debtors in a good rnund sum. The possibility of such an event would reconcile us to some presGnt sacrifice and future losses. A large loan from the substantial farmers, gentry, and merchants of Ireland ! Whnt an idea ! There is not a man in all England who, in order to realize it, would not work double tidAs to pay off the en­cumbrance, and endure to be taunted with the obligation in every town and b-irony of the green island. There is na amount of labour, however !evere, or of taxation, however heavy, that English men would not readily undergo, in order to discharge a debt of so novel, so unex­pected, and so stimulating a character. But, as yet, there is no prospect of it. We must be content to hear of the unex­plained sixty millions, of which we are the upbraided, but unconscious, de­faulters, and to satisfy an unknown debt by unthanked contributions.

"ADMINISTRATION OF A POOR LAW. (LETTER TO. THE EDITOR, WEDNESDAY, .APRIL 7, 1847.) Sir,-Your paper has taken a distin­guished position as the 'advocate of an effective Poor Law for IrEland. Feeling in common with you that a measure of this nature can alone lay a foundation for any improvement in the condition of the peuple of that portion of the United Kingdom, I am anxious that when a triumphant majority of the House of Commons has forcad this measure through its previous stages, its uses and operation should not be destroyed by the indirect but more dangerous assaults of its oppo­nents. I am, therefore. desit-ous to be permitted to refer to some poiuts which I think may not be sufficiently understood by the British public. '-~ The present tactic of the opposing section of Irish landlords 11.nd their Eng­lish supporters is to defeat the action of the measure by the non-collection of rates. This would be the certain effect of the clause moved by Lord George Ben­linck on Monday night. I am inclined to hope that the noble Lord did not und£rstand the result which his own motion would produce ; and that he was made the instrument of others to defeat in this way the measure which he had himself voted for. This proposition was only defeated by a majority of three, and, as it is confidently expected by the Irish rarty that i~ will be successful in the Lords,I think it is a matter of importance that its object and operation should. 119 clearly sl1<,ted. The purport of the clause proposed by Lord George Bentinck was to repeal tl at power given to the tenant by tµe IrLh Poor Law Act of dEducting from the landlord's rent a certain proportion of the rate paid by the tenant in the first instance, which proportion amounted~ when the valuation and rent were equal, to one-half of the whole rate, or to a larger proportion when the rent exceeded the valuation-the scale operating in such manner that as the rent became highei than the valuation the landlord paid a greater proportion, till, in the event of the rent being double the valuation; the tenant became entitled to deduct the whole rate from bis rent ; and in all cases wherein the rent was less than the valuation, the tenant, in like manner; was entitled to deduct a proportion-lesa than the half-corresponding with the degree in which the rent was lower than the valuation. The intention of the Legislature in this en:::ctment was to ims pose a pE nalty on rack-renting and a tax upon absenteeism, and to force from the rich an aid in the support of the poor. Lord George Bentinck's clause would abolish tbis most equitable division of the rate between the landlord and the tenant, and throw the whole burden of tl:e rate i.ingly on the tenant, except with regard to the rates of tenemcntsunder£5value,'forwhich the landlord would be directly responsible. This proposition was most artfully sup­ported by the Irish landlord section, on the plea of an assimilation of the law of Ireland to that of England, and I fear much that many English members were deluded by this specious argument. It is true that such has been the English 1aw for perhaps 300 years ; tho rights of pro­perty and the relations of landlord and tenant have gradually been framed into a conformity with this law, and, therefore, it would not now be expedient to disturb it; but, in creating a new law for Ireland, I ask, is it not fitiing and necessary to take into consideration the different system of lancU-,rdi,m in Ireland and in England 1 The English tenant is in a condition to make a bargain with a land­lord; and to address him thus, ""You offer me this farm, with the buildings and improvements, at (suppose) 40s. an acre, but I find it will be liable to 10s. rates ; I cannot have f dr profits and give you more than 30s. an acre."" Other competi­tors, looking to a fair return for capital, offer no higher rent. The landlord is :thus-compelled to reduce his land to the marketable value, founded on a fair calcu­lation of the _tenant's returns, and thus ;17irtually pays t1ie whole rates, although the occupier is di_rectly liable. But can the Irish tenant assume this independent position 1 No such thing. The poor Irish tenant must have land or starve-he can get no wages t.Jr labour wherewith to buy food-he .cannot have food. except wha:i; he raise~ by liis labour on land in his oc­oupation. Others are in the same posi­tion, an unnatural competition is pro­duced,, excited by the most powerful of a11 stimulants-the dread of the want of food, without any relation to the value of the land or the charges affecti~ it. The multiplicity of claimants gives the lii.ndlord full power of extortion-a rent is, fixed by what is called letting by cant (I.speak of the rack-rented portions of lreland)-the power of extortion is un­limited, every burden is cast on the tenant, until he is reduced to the neces­sitv of a miserable existence on the lowest description even of. potato food. The Irish tenant is not a free agent, and, therefore, has a justclaim on the Legis­lature for that protection which the enact­ment in the original Poor Law Act was intended to afford nim. This was sub­mitted to by the landlords so long as the Irish Poor Law existed in the state of an imbecile delusio'n on the people ; but now, when it is about to assume the form of a substantial remedy to preserve the pour from starvation, and to create a rial responsibiliLy on property, this whole­some and jtrnt provision is decfarod a nui,ance to be allowed no longer to re­main on the statute-hook. The proposi­tion of Lord George Bentinck was but feebly resisted by Sir George Grey on the part of the novernment ; he opposed the clause as inexpedient. at the presen~ time, "" but he was anxious to say nothing which could prejudice the consideraticn of the noble lord's proposition at a future period ; "" and that future period will arrive, as I very much fear, when the Bill is returned from the Lords wJth the clause inserted, and then the resistance of the Government, 1 if I' can guess at futurity, will cease. Thus the poor occ.u­pying tenants, in the rack-renting dis­tricts of Ireland, already ground to the earth by landlord oppression and mis­rule, and betrayed by landlord selfishness, will have a new infliction added to tl:eir present intolerable burdens. l'l!e absentee landlords will clap their hands with delight at their escape from the duties of property, and the resident rack-renters may continue to shut their demesne gates upon th-; poor man, as they h!tve heretofore clone, and sciy, "" Thus far you may co~e, but no farther. 'lhe poor shall contrnue to support the poor­we are saved from confiscation of Pro­perty."" Vain imagin&tion ! The oppres­sion of the poor tenant will produce a more deadly confiscation by its natural results ; rents will not b~ paid, and every fresh extortion will add to the evil ; then real confiscation will come from the absolute poverty of the people-­pauperism will increase,and the pauperism of the people will create pauperism of the lan-dlords---tha just retribution of neglected duties. It is clear that the Irish Poor Law Bill will be a npnentity if rates cannot be col­lected. Now, I shall proceed to show how that effect will be produced, if Lord George Bentinck's clause be carried. You are told rates are now imperfectlt collected. This must proceed either from the poverty of the people or their un­willingness to pay the rates-I believe chiefly from the latter cause, and why so Y Because the law, as hitherto constituted, was ineffective for relief. They see their fellow-creatures starving, and no means of feeding them,as the Act excludes e;irternal relief, the houses filled with poor and cor rupted by disease, the entrance into such houses tfte mere prelude to death-why should they not be unwilling to pay the rates for an administration of relief so cruelly stinted Y Now, the law may be improved, but if Lord George Bentinck's clause be p11ssed, it will contain new principles of injustice-namely, the ex­emption of landlord responsibility accom­panied with an increase of ex officio guardians, placing the administration of the law in the hands of this favoured class, who have proved themselves its relentless opponents. Disgust and mis­trust will take pos~ession of the people's minds, they will refuse the payments ; the passive resistance principle, formerly Bo e1fe:tual in the case of tithes, will be adopted; distresses mav be made, but no purchasers will be found for the goods ; the sale will thus become an empty name, because the rate will be a rank injustice. I firmly believe a just, liberal,and humane Poor Law would meet the sanction of the people, and that the rates would be paid to the uttermost farthin~ of their capa­bilities ; but .a law poisoned with this provision, if so passed, will create an un­conquerable spirit of resistance. .Again, ,vith regard to that portion of the rate which is now imposed directly on the landlords for tenements under £4 value (and which it is proposed to increase to £5 value), we have information that the payment is now refused or evaded ; that the landlords avail themselves of technical objections ; that their rates are more difficult of collection than the tenants' rates ; and that they have even now, with their present limited number of ex offici-> guardians, sufficient influence in the boards to prevent the proper steps being taken to put the law in force. It is very material this point should 'be under­stood. The Act of the 7th Victoria, c. 92, provides that if the rate chargeable directly on the landlord be not-paid within four months, it shall be lawful for the board to levy the same (after a month's notice given) by distress on the occllpier's goods. .A little manrenvring will easily effect this retardation. The boards crammed with ex officioswill let o'.f the landlords and di,strain the occupier, and the return will be no goods and no rates. But, it will be said, the law allows the occupier of these low~valued tene­ments, when distraine d for 'landlord's rat(\s, to deduct the payment from the rents. I would ask. what chance would a poor occupier of this description have in a contention to recover rates from an Irish middle landlord, or an Irish rack­renting proprietor, or the rack-renting agent of an Irish absentee ? He would not dare to name the rate to these owners or receivers of rents-the power to do so is a mere farce, an entire delusion. I think I have now proved that under a law defiled with such a provision as that submitted by Lord George Bentinck no rates would be levied ; but this is the very object which the opposing section of Irish landlords desire to effect. They have prophesfod no rates would be ob­tained ; they are now labouring to verify their own predictions. The Irish people will be again starving, and the responsi­bility will be again thrown on the Govern­ment, and the relief of Irish misery will be again a drain upon the resouroi,s sup­plied by Bi:itish industry. I forewarn the representatives of Eng­land that if they desire a Poor Law for Ireland which shall have any substantial use -or action, they must accompany it with a measure which shall secure the liability of the landlord for the just pro­portion of the rates as heretofore ; and this liability cannot be effective unless the landlord and tenant be made sepa­rately liable !)ach for his respective pro,. prrtion. So long as you continue to levy the landlord's rates through the means of distress on the tenant's goods, the tenant will be oppressed, the r1.t€s will be resisted, and the levy will be im­practicable ; and no other means can be adopted for the effectual levy of the land­lord's rates, except by taking a powu to place a receiver on the estates where rates are unpaid ; this will be effectual, as evidenced in the case of the titki rent-: charge. Unless the Irish Poor Law Act­be accompanied with a measure for the just distribution aud effective levy d the rates in the manner I have suggested, I emphatically assert it will be of no more value than the waste paper on which it is printed. Such a measure I have intro­duced in the House of Commons, and it n'lw lies £. r the disposal of th;, Legis lature. In these, and in other statemrn's which I have made in my place in Parlia.ment, I wish not to be understood as att1cl,ing­individual landlords. I attack tho sy, t ,m of Irish landlordism, as exhibited with­out doubt, or even a.n attempt at contra­diction, in various evid'lnces ond reµ--rts to be found in-the reccrds of Parliam nt. I do not deny the . individual worth :md oharita ble exertions of many land­lcrds disposed over every part of Irehnd, 0 I do not deny that many who are now opposing this Poor Law do so from an honest apprehension of its injurious re sults as well on the people as themselves. T_he system of Irish Jandlordism taints, more or less, all our proceedings on the r_elationship of landlord and tenant. I do not desire to exempt myself, or my predecessors, from the fault, at least, of neglecting much which should have been done ; but the more sensible I am of the evils which the system produces, even under the best circumstances,..the more strongly it appears to me to be my duty to labour in the cause of its exposure and correction.

"PROPOSAL FOR IRISH COLONISATION IN CANADA. (LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 7, 1847.) We have already directed attention to the means by which it has b€en proposed to mitigate the distress of Ireland. Perhaps 110 stronger testimony to the severity of that distress could be.found than the scheme which certain noblemen and gentlemen of that country submitted to the notice of Lord Jom, RussELL. The transportation of some thousands of pauper cottiers for the purpose of found­ing a pauper colony in America is just such a measure as ought only to be sug­gested when every other device had either failed or become hopeless. And till eyery other plan has been tried, it will be an unacc0untable tell'.}erity-perhaps we should say a great crime-on the part of any Ministry to people the forests of Canada with an immigration isolated by religion, language, and social habits from the mass of the colonists by which it is to be surrounded and the Govern­ment on which it is to depend. Even had the ordinary purposes of colocization been kbpt in mind, and its ordinary. pre­parations made, it would have been a dangerous experiment to settle a large Celtic sept under its natur~l and here­ditary chiefs in a remote dependency of the Crown. Jealousies and heartburn­iugs, unintentional but unavoidable­causes of separation manifold and insu­perable, would, evtin under such circum­stances, have occurred to show the follv of giving at tho rnmo time the force of combination and the greater force of isolation to a multitude whose allegiance must always be lukewarm and whose sympathies must bo weakened by dis­tance. But when tl e scheme professedly rejects an ordinary element of all modes of colonization-wheD, instead of planting a community comprehenc::ing all ranks of society, and bearing the decided stamp of social ord1,r, it is intended to trans­plant only one class,and thatthe weakest, the most ijupiue, and the least educated of all-suspicious are naturally aroused at the daring imprudence of the specula­tion, and its detected insufficiency as a makeshift. . . Whilst wo admit the justice of the pro­position embodied in the memorial, that any plan of emigration, to be satisfac­torily carried out, must emanate from private enterprise, we are convinced by attending to the incidents of every day that the time has not yet come in whic:i private capital and private ene.rgy are to do all for these objects which they are heriafter destined to.effect. The subject has been gradually looming on the minds of statesmen ; it has begun to assume a somewhat more definite and intelligible shape than that which it once bad. _Men are reconciling themselves not only to the immediate necessity, but the eventual duties of colonization. It is no longer regarded simply. as the shortest means for getting rid of so much wretched poverty, and liberating people at home from its unfortunate supplications ; it is now viewed, as it ought to be, in refe­rence to the fate of the political sodeties of which it lays the foundation, and_:Jheir influence upon the civilized world): But while the theory of colonization Va's thus become more di11tinct and potential in the eyes of thinking men, the capital which it is necessary to invest in prose­cuting its objects has been absorbed into other channels. The last few years-and more particularly the last year-have seen the fruits of the national industry locke:l up in the exacting, but not Un £?rat0ful, coffers of one gigantic enter­ prise. For years to come the speculations and the resources of commerce will be confined within one channel. They will in vain endeavour to escape. But as soon as their liberation has been effected, and they have been diverted into new courses, we shall, perhaps, see the unexhausted wealth and industry of England co-opera­ting to discover new sources of wealth and new springs of industry by schemes of colonization worthy of beincr called national, comprehensive, and statesman­like. W hen this time sl1all have arrived people will look back with wonder to the epoch in which it was gravely proposed to create in Canada a sectarian province of Irish Roman Catholics, and will ask what means had been exhausted for pro-. v:iding at home for the people whom it was thus intended to expatriatA. The wonder and the curiosity will be equally just. It will then appear that after three centuries . of social. disorganization, an effort had been at last earnestly made to put the different classes on their proper footing-to lay its equitable burdens on IJI'OpPrty, and give t? poverty its just r~lief. We hope that 1t will not in ad­dition have to be related that all the scope of the proposed law was lost, and t)le intentions of its authors defeated, by the trickery of an insidious amendment, and tbat, under the pretence of adsimilat­ing the English and Irish Poor Laws, the Irish landlords succeeded in introducing a clause which at once disgusted the mass of the ratepayers, and made the collec­tion of the rates impossible. Yet such would have been the result had Lord G . BENTINCK's amendment in committee been carried. The tenant ratepayer of Ireland would have borne the whole burden of the rate .from which his land­lord would have been exempted, Disgust universal would have immediately been aroused ; but the eventual consequence would have been, as Mr. S. CRAWFORD folls us, in a letter to which we rpfer our readers, that not a single rate could have been collected. Distresses would have been unavailing, for all the force of the law would have been met by the stubborn, inertia of passive resistance. That this dangerous coup d'etat may yet be attempted in the House of Lords is far from improbable ; nor is its success there an impossible contingency. But, if the amendment be carried there, it will be one of the most .unfortunate pieces of legislation to which their Lordships ever put their hands. Forfrom the moment it is enacted, confiscation-actual, sweepilig confiscation-not that metaphorical one of which we read in reviews and speeches -but confiscation, arising .from penury unrelieved and labour u11eIIJployed, will become a substantial danger. As Mr. CRAWFORD writes, ""The .Iril!h people wilhgain be starving; the responsibility­will again be thrown on Government ; and the relief of Irish misery will be again a drain on the resources supplied by British industry."" But let not landlorda, great or small, lay the flattering unction to their souls, that in this .extremity they will pacify English justice, or ward off their own Nemesis, byexpatriating Celtio pauperism to the banks of the ;st.

"THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CLERGY IN IRELAND. (LEADING ARTICLE; THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1847.), ''fo have frequently ventured to remind t.he Roman Cat,holic clergy of Ireland, that assuming, as they do, to be the leaders of the people, and being,to a great exten.t, actually in that position, they are bound to do all they can to reform the habits and enlighten the . understandings of their flocks. They are not, indeed, backward to a1vise; on the contrary, they are only too ready touse foi;_ temporat purposes Fhe awful prestige of spirilual authority. They do not hesitate to ex­press themselves warmly on the questions of the -day, nor do thoy seem to he fettered by a nervous timidity as to the casual effects of their language. We may. tllerefore, reasonably expect them to give the. advfoe most xeqvired by the charaoter and condition of the people, and most suited to the .crisis. . In Engla;nd we certainly expect this from the lips of .our clergy~ Moreover, there is a certain wholeness and oneness about the very idea of duty'wbfoh_fca:bids any partial . fulfilment. Whoever 1t be that teaohes a people, cannot, with~t a palpable dis honesty and absurdity, pick and -0h<1ose from the virtues, cut and carve the com G 2 mandments, inculcate this, and let alone that, by the rule of convenience or other such motive. Now, in this country there is one virtue which the clergy do not omit to urge on their flocks. The duty of honest industry is early impressed on the child, and driven home with continual blows on the man. To do bis duty in that state of life to which PROVIDENCE has been pleased to call him is almost the most definite and peremptory idea of obligation in an Eng­lishman's mind. The whole nation feels one common impulse to work. .All classes, high and low, rich and poor, know they have a. task to be done. Everybody 1s miserable till he finds out his office. An idle man in this island feels himself out of place. He wanders about like an evil spirit, seeking rest, and seeking it in vain. Work, work is the order of the day wh.irever you go. Dukes, millionaires, meh of science, clergymen, old ladies, _young ladies, all are unhappy, because they are solita.ry and contemptible unless they are doing something, and known to be doing it. To be doing nothing is worse than the Oriental opprobrium of barrenness. "" What doAs such an one do with himself 7"" is the most insulting question an enemy can ask. On numerous classes the pressure is absolutely over­-whelming. They are not allowed a holi­day. JoaN GrLPIN's twice ten years of drudgery,unchequeredwith a single dayof leisure, is by no means uncommon. Our labourers give every day of their lives to the service of their country, without the subtraction of one hour, excepting only Sundayd and two or three holidays in the year. How they find time to say a word to their friends,-how they digest their meals,-how get five quiet minutes with their children,how they say their prayers at least between Lady-day and Michael­mas, is a wonder to all but those in the secret. Toil hunts them down. The laws compel IR.hour, the farmer commands it, the clergyman enjoins it, the family re­quires it, the country expects it, self­preservaHon leaves no alternative,­every motive conspires. So the labourer, and, like him, all other working men,­lawyers, medical mim, merchants, shop­keepers included, work and think and think and work, till their brains are dried to dust, their sinews to whipcord, and their souls to parchment. Wishing most heartily, as we do, that the English might be spared some of this slavery, we have no wish to impose it on Ireland. "" All work and no play makes JAOK a dull boy."" We sh()u]d be sorry to spoil that natural vivacity and wit which throw such a charm over the eccen­tricities, follies, and infirmities of the Irish character. At the same time, we must. say that England has a right to ex­pect something more than three or four months' work in the year from all the subjects of thii\ realm ; and she has a. right to expect that the advisers who have occupied the ear of Ireland should back up so reasonable a demand. It is not fit that England should always suffer a monopoly of working and paying. R-elit.f for Ireland ; rest for England. Miserable and degraded as the case of the former country is, the peasant still has a. com­pensation. He enjoys for weQks and months the luxury of idleness. He has , time to tell stories, to hand down tradi­tions, to practise his wit, to talk about politics, to play with sediton, to attend fairs, races, monster meetings, midnight trainings, adventures, and councils. If he is now to be maintained by British money in the enjoyment of theEe luxuries, it is evident that the English peasant pays for all this. Now, we say, that while the Irishman has a claim to the Englishman's money, that is, to the pro­duce of his labour, the Englishman has a claim in his turn to a little of the Irish­man's rest. Would that the English were a little less occupied, the Irish a little more! Our readers have aH of them read many pastoral addresses and public resolutions of Irish Roman Catholic clergy. We ask them,-Do they re­member that in any one there occurs such a thing asavigorous and pointed ad­monition to regular industry 1 -Do they remember any expostulation with that which is notoriously the crying evil of Ire­land,-'-its universal sloth _7 Have they ever observed one single text to this effect out of the many hundreds in Holy Writ quoted by sacerdotal pen 1 Does Dr, M'HALE, in addressing the least thrifty and industrious people in Europe cite the words of the "" Wise Man,"" or the sound common sense of the Apostolic Epistles, in favour of diligence,' economy, pru­dence, or other such vulgar but respect­able virtues 1 On the contrary, every word uttered by these clerical authorities appears to have no other design than to unnerve the people, to teach them not to depend on themselves, and wait for some­thing or other from England, from Lord JORN RUSSELL, from Mr. LABOUCRERE, from the landlords, from Repeal, from confiscation, or from any other quarter, event, person, or thing .After that hideous wretchedness which discolours and deforms the very land­scape of Ireland, the very first thing that strikes a stranger of ordinary intelligence fresh from the industrious sphere of England is the extraordinary apathy of tho people amidst ab}ect wretchedness and the comparative ease with which that wretchedness might, by the slightest exertion and enterprise, be converted into comfort and plenty. An instance, to use a common phrase, will speak volumes on this point. It is known that .the rivers and seas of Ireland abound in excellent fish, and that this year the shoals are more numerous than ordinary, but, as usual, are generally leH to pursue their course unmolested. Perhaps the extent of this neglect is not realized. The other day a gentleman of Cork, the manager of some mines at the ill-fated and ill-famed village of Scull, which is about 10 miles from 'Skibbereen on the coast, borrowed a common rod and line from a Cornish miner in his employ, and caught 57 mackerel from the jetty in Scull Bay before breakfast. Each of these mackerel was worth 2d. in Cork market, 30 miles off,"" Yet not a man was attempt­ing to catch them, or doing anything but wait upon PROVIDENCE, and expect Eng­lish meal and money. Now, here is a case for the clergy at once. An .Apostle would not hesitate to rebuke such neglect of the provision which PROVIDENCE has brought, as it were, to the very hands -and mouths of the-mo~t famished district of the island. He would bid his followers to let down their nets for a draught,in faithful expec­tation of those miracles which industry and prudence will always achieve. But, like people, like priest. Populus vult decipi and an obsequious hierarchy, de­pendent not on the prosperity but on the passion of the people, withholds those homely, but disagreeable, lessons, which alone can save Ireland. Decipi(l,tur, they say in their hearts, and leave Ireland to its fatalism, to listlessness, dependence, and inevitable ruin. THE FAMINE OF 1741.",THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CLERGY IN IRELAND,2,4/8/1847
"(LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 1847.) It might naturally be supposed that the philosophy which teaches by example would imprint its lessons more deeply on the human heart than that which preaches abstractedly, and that genuine instances of suffering would warn mankind more efficaciously than all the grave saws of morals or of politics. Unfortunately, this is not so ; at least, it is not so in Ire­land. There, tho history of the past speaks without effect, and the sufferings of the past are recorded without admoni­tion. .A £amine in one century signalizes its havoc by causes and consequences which are forgotten and repeated in the next. The most desolating prntilence sweeps away its thoU:sands,and is scarcely remembered after it has ceased to slay. The circumstances which either provoked it, or aggravated its intensity, are swamped by the unaccountable carelees­ness of the many and the unpardonable indifference of the few. , Diet, clothing, comfort, the things which affect all these, ss the tenure of land, provision for tho poor, rents, subdivision of estatPs, early marriages, unemployed multitudes, &c., all of which must have been recognized as contributing to the magnitude of one great calamity, are all overlooked as soon as its immediate pressure has subsided. In the years 1740 and 1741 Ireland was visited with a severe £amine and a de­structive pestilence. Their records, as originally presented in the journals of that day, have been recently reprinted for private distribution. The perusal of this document is painfully curious. It would apply, with hardly an alteration, to the famine of the present year. Except that the population has increased from two to eight millions, ,there is hardly a fact which is not as true in 1847 as it was in 1741.. Instead of the aphis t'<lstafcr the destroying power was a pr~mature frost. But the food that suffered m both years was the same-the precarious and insuffi­cient potato. The consequences were the same ; the horrors witnessed the same ; the sentiments or prejudices the same ; the deeds of admirable kindness or exEcrablo heartlessness the same ; the anticipations of a worse future and of the doom that would then visit the empire the same ; the supplies, both of food and charity the same: May we hopa that the forgetfulness and want of provisi9n for the future may not be the same in 1847 that they were in 1741 Y The first emphatic notice of the state of things in 1740, and dated the 22d of January, is this :­ "" Ladies undertake to give all their winnings at q1tadrille to the poor."" Then collections are ordered. Next we hear of sheep dying, and a drought con­tinuing from Christmas to April,-omens more fearful than presaged the present calamity ; then starvation -America looked to, as now, for: the-supply of pro­visions ; -then proclamations issued against forestallers. But one measure, far more wise and more useful than 1nter­ference with dealers or their prices, was one which it would have been desirable to, reintroduce within the last four t1Donths :­ "" Dublin, January 3', 1741. ""-His Grace ihe Lord Primate, and other charitable gentlemen of this city, in. order to eaae the city of the great number of strolling beggars resorting tliereto from all parts of the kingdom, and to relieve the truty necessitous, have notified to the governors of the work­house that they are willing, at their own private expense, to give one meal each iiay to every person,who shall be deemed by the governors of the house entitled 'to such charity. And, oD Monday last, the said governors, at a irineral board, came to a resolution that tickets shall be sent to fflch governor now in town, that he may distribute them occasionally to all such persons as are obliged,. through the deadness of trade and dearness of bread, to seek relief through the streets and suburbs ofthis city. The said tickets are to be signed by the governors distribu­ting them, who are to insert the name of the person, wHh the number of children fa his or her family~ who are directed to go to the workliouse for such relief. u On Thursday last the officers began to give one full meal to all such person­as came with said tickets, and it is hoped, since such provision is made for the poor, the inhabitants of this city will discou­rage all vagrant beggarir and give their assistance that they may be sent to Bride­well to hard labour, and thereby free themselves from a set of idlers who are a scandarand a reproach to the nation.'' If the present Government had exer­cised a test of this kind, the Board of Works-would. have had the satisfaction of paying wages to the indigent and the in­dustrious, not to the idle, the disaffected, and the buyers of firearms. Disease was, of course, rife. "" We hear,"" says the journal ah:eady 9.11oted, "" that numbers of people daily die of fluxes and fevers, from want of proper food, and that there is great sickneRs amongst horses, of which numbers die, which the poor people eat for want of other victuals !"" New York and Phjla<lelphia-then small towns of a remote province-sent "" a great relief to the poor "" of Galway and Limerick. That we have improved somewhat on the former principle of giving assistance, though the principle has not fairly been carried out in nractice, may be gathered from the follow1ng suggestion :­ "" It is earnestly recommended to every great corporation and private gentleman in this time of distress, to set forward some work, such as paving, fencing, draining, making roads or canals, cleans­ing harbours, &c., which would employ all that would work, and c.Iear the country of strolling vagrants, who, if found begging, should be sent to Bridewell, or whipped.; the common pretence of want of work being removed. Corporations and private gentlemen would be at no greater expense by this charitable pro­vision of work, they would only employ more hands at this time when the neces­sities of the poor call for them, and £ewes hands at other times when the necessitier are over ; whereas giving charity to those who are able to work without re­quiring work from them is an encourage ment to idleness and a public loss."" Another incident to the famine of. 1741 finds a wournful parallel in that of 1847. The people on the coast had then, as they have now, a ready and present storehouse of provisions in the sea. But we read no account of their availing themselves of the advantages which Nature had fur­nished for them. They were content to T'eceive tickets, and be fed by alms. That they did not work on land was perhaps the fault of the Government and the proprietors. But that they abstained from fishing in the sea can be attributed only to their own inertness. As it hap, pened, fish in some parts did constitute a great proportion of the food consumed. But it was imported from Scotland. Faulkner's Journal for Maroh, 1741, mentions this :­ "" Quantities of herrings are come over from Fife, besides a great deal from Dunbar; a seasonable relief for the poor. It is computed the boats commonly catch from 20,000 to 30,000 a-day each. They sell in Fife at from 40 to 50 pence per thousand."" So unchanged are the people and their habit, within the last 100 years ! And what reflections does not this suggest ! It might perhaps excite some­thing like a momentary sentiment of triumph to observe that the boasted Irish Parliament and rampant nationality allowed the people to dnk into a 11tate so abject and so forlorn. But no feeling of triumph can harmcnize with the contem­plation of such gigantic improvidElnee e.nd incurable lethargy as are exemplified in the present state of Ireland. The re­proach that we would launch against a provincial Parliament or proprietary redounds upon ourselves. We feel that if they were careless through ignorance, we have been careless without ignorance : and that if they sinned from want of warning, we have sinned after warning. For is it not a great sin to have left a people,multiplied hy time, to the chances of the poorest and most uncertain root 1 Is it not a sin to have enacted no laws and instituted no customs which should correet the tendencies of the Celtic dis­position and the habits of a Celtic popu lation 1 We found them ignorant, indi­gent, and indolent. Have we en­lightened them, enriched them, or in""' spired them with energy 'I Have we strengthened their sentiment of inde­pendence hy the discipline which has braced the mind of the sturdy Anglo­Saxon 7 Or have we suffered them to grovel in the squalor of contented pauperism and revel in the imposture of a beggarly proprietary? If we have for­gotten our duties, we must bA content to share the opprobrium of Irish helpless­ness and Irish want with ~hat wretuhed fiction of legislation, the Irish Parlia­ment. But we must not rest here. Our penitence will be worse than useless without amendment. Our future must atone for our past. We must educate and elevate Ireland, by teaching her people to educate and elevate themselves. THE DISTRESS IN MAYO.","(LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 14, 1847.)",2,4/14/1847
"(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1847.) Sir,-It may be in the recollection of and receiving urgent and perplexing some of your readers, that when we city appAals for relief from various resident gentlemen were reviled last year by the clergymen and landlords, decided on "" noble country party "" for the selfish-despatching one of their numbel' to the ness of our pursuits and the inutility of snot, to examine into the state of affairs our lives, as compared with those of and relieve the people promptly. As I deputy-liet1,tenants and county magis-had been loudest in my condemnation of trates, I availed myself of your kindness the conduct of both English and Irish to vindicate as well as I could in your landlords, and had boasted-I now feel columns the order to which it is my pride somewhat injudiciously-of what I would to belong. do were I in their placA, I was selected Perhaps, however, the taunts of the for t.his not very agreeable service.

If you can moneyed magnatO'J of London, have at spare me room in your columns, I pur­lea.st since last year nobly borne their pose to lay before the public as accurate a share in attempting to relieve famine-sketch as I can draw of what is actually stricken.Ireland ; and I have endeavoured happening-here. to follow in their footsteps-longo inter-, The barony contains 185,000 acres ot uaUo, I admit. land, over which are scattered a popu- The Committee of the British Asno-lation of 30,000 souls. The little town eiation for the Relief of Distress in Ire-of Letterbrick is placed in the bight of j land, reading frightful accounts of pesti-deep bay, one of the many noble habours lence and famine in U1e county of Mayo, with which the west of Ireland abounds.' The Union workhouse is 31 miles dis­tant ; besides that there is neither hospi­tal nor dispensary of which the poor can avail themselves at the present moment. Of three resident Protestant clergymen, one is insane ; the other two are not on speaking terms, and will not "" act "" together in any way. The three Roman Cathvlic priests are good, simple men­poor and ignorant, and possessing little influence over their flocks. Two-thirds of this vast extent of land is divided between two proprietors-Mr. Black, of Kildare, and the Mulligan, who resides in his baronial castle of Ballymull.igan. The Mulligan having been an Irish man of pleasure is now a bankrupt; he amuses himself in: his dominions as well as he can, but has lately been cast in damages for the seduction of the daughter of a coast-guard, and is in consequence at pre­sent playing at hide and seek with the offiters of the law ; he is a married man ; he is the only resident magistrate in Arderry, aud as his present discreditable social position renders him only accessible on Sundays, he is utterly useless in that capacity. Bis tenants are not in arrear. They have been driven, ejected, and sold up with incredible severity. To give you an idea of what the people here endure and the landlords i:erpetrate, I will state that last week, accompanied by two credible English witnesses, I met sew,ral ema­ciated cows, driven by two men, and follov,ed by their still more emaciated owners, proceeding towards Letterbrick. Istopped them and inquired whither they were going ? The two men said they were taking them to the Letterhrick-pound for rent owing to them. The oeas1nts declared that the rent was not due till the 1st of May. Their landlord admitted this readily ; bnt added, that Letterbrick fair was on the 12th of April, and he feared, unless he pounded his tenants' cattle before that, that they would sell them at the fair and be off to America. So he did pound them, for a debt that was not yet due ; and the poor, ignorant, starved wretches allowerl lllm to do it. Of the Mulligan's exedions arid chari­ties to meet the presrnt crisis, it is need­less to speak. He is chafrmau of a relief committee, which he nernr attends ; he has given no money or food, whilst he has extracted all ho can from 1l,e soil. He rays no taxes, builds no co1tages or farm buildings, supi:orts no schools or hospitals. The only duties which he attempts to perform a.re those which he considers he owes to l1imself. He and his family own about 40,000 acres of land. His uncie I saw when he came to pro­pose to the purser on board the Horrible steamer in charge of a cargo of seed, to let him have some on the security of his "" paner at six months ;"" and when we were-landing some meal in the rain from that vessel, his brother gallopped into the town in a rickety tandem, pulled up to stare at us, and after having played an amatory national air on a horn which he had slung round him, gallopped off again. Mr. Black, his co-proprietor, is a land­lord of a very different species. He re­sides in Kildare, where he has a large pi;operty, and, by his own account, takes an active part in the duties of the county. Here he is represented by his agent, Mr. White, a most intelligent and gentle­manlike young man, who spends a few months occasionally in Arderry, and is a magistrate. I will not take the liberty of Raying anything more of Mr. Black, as the correspondence which I have hau with bim will speak for itself. I append it to this letter. A variety of small and sub landlords, whose lives are spent in watching the growing crops and cattle of their tenants, and pouncing upon them the moment they are ripe or fit for rnle, occupy the rest of the barony, anq complete the misery of the people. There is one single man who believes that he has duties to perform, and does hi8 best to fulfil them ; but as his pro­perty is small, the good he can do is but as a drop inthis ocean of human iniquity, and, being a Dublin lawyer, he is neces­sarily an absentee. At this moment there is no food in the country save what is imported by Govern­ment and the British Association ; 'neither have the people any money, save what they earn on the public works, which are to b~ stopped in May. The land is unsown-there will be no harvest. The Horrible when she was here s~Jling seed under prime cost sold. but £100 worth ; and that almost entirely to the benevolent individual have alluded to. At Killala, where the gentry clamoured loudly for seed, the Lightning was sent with 350 sacks, of which she sold one ; and at Killibegs the Horrible had no better market. There is at this moment, Sir, fever in half the houses in Arderry-I call them houses by courtesy, for -they are but hollow, damp, and filthy dungheai;s. The people sell their last rag for food, and are then forced to remain in their hovels until the weakest sink from hunger ; their festering corpses, which they have no means of removing, then breed a fever which carries off the rest. Efficient medicines or medical aid they have none, and if they had, what but good food could be prescribed with s1ic­cess to a starving man 1 During the short time I have been here I have seen my £allow creatures die in the streets. I have found the naked bodies of women on the road side, and piles of coffini, con­taining corpses left outside the cabins and in the market-place. I have met mothers carrying about dead infants in their arms until they were putrid, refusing to bury them, in the hope that the offensive sight might wring charity from the callous townspeople sufficient to protract for a while the lives of the other children at home. During the last two days I have buried at my own expense 20 bodies, which, had I not done so, would be still infecting the living. J must here pause to remind you, Sir, that I am a man of, business, deliberate and calculating, nowise given to exag­geration, and that what I am detailing to you is not the recollection of some hortid nightmare, but a state of society within two days' post of London. The people here, naturally docile, become uncontrol­lable at the sight of provisions-not a bag of biscuit can be landed _or leave the town without an armed escort, not a vessel can anchor in the bay without imminent risk of being plundered. Yesterday, three vessel~, bound to the north, were becalmed off the coast ; they were instantly boarded and cleared by the famished and desperate peasaniiry. I purchased a little see-i myself, which I retailed in small quantities to the people, chiefly to gain some insight into their position: I found them utterly hopeless, almost indiffer'ent about sowing, because they are aware that any crops they may sow will be 11eized on for rent by the landlords. They preferred buying turnip and parsnip seed, although they appeared quite ignorant how to cultivate them, because the perishable nature of these roots renders them less, convenient for seizure than barley or oats. On my arrival here I found the s0up kitchen, on which the lives of hundreds depends, stopped, not for want of fun<ls, but because the vicar and the curate, having £130 intrusted to them jointly by our associa_tion, had quarrelled, and pre­ferred seeing the parishioners starve to making soi;ip for them in concert. Lest I may be suspooted of caricature or ex­aggeration, I will, in conclusion, set down what my eyes have seen during the last half hour. I have seen in the court­house an inquest holden on the body of a boy of 13, who, being left alone in a cabin, with a little rice and fish in his charge, was murdered by his cousin, a boy of 12, for the sake of that wretched pittance of food. A verdict of "" Wilful Murder "" has since been returned. The culprit is the most famished and sickly little creature I ever saw, and his relatives, whom I heard ex­amined, were all equally emaciated and fever-stricken.) Driven from the court by the stench of the body, I passed in the street two coffins with bodies in them, in going to my lodgings from the court-housl'), a dis­ tance of a hundred yards. I am prepared to hear that the trutli of what I have here stated had been impugned;_ to be informed that I am ignorant of the habits of the people, and that I have been hum­ bugged by Irishmen ha~ing a natural turn for humour. I am prepared to be ridiculed for my obesity, and to be told that a London banker is out of his element. in the romantic regions of the west. I should not wonder if the Mulligan callee!. me out. lj f~l certain "" he will court an inquiry."" To all this I will answer, that to the truth of all I have here stated I can, for­ tunately, produce credible English witnesses ; that if the people have at­ tempted to humbug me in the'midst of the horrors which surround 'us, the less they boast of their mistimed humour the better ; that by showing that I am uri~ gracefully corpulent, and an indifferent snipe shot, they will not prove them­ selves to be humane landlords ; and if the Mulligan e1'hibits any leaning to­ wardB the duello, I will inform him that, although constitutionally timid, I can take care of myl:lelf very well,having taken the precaution before I left London to borrow from an American friend, who is under some pt,cuniary obligations to our house, an excellent pair of Colt's revolvers-weapons, I believe, altogether new in the west of Ireland, but which are as effective in the. hands of a flaccid cockney, as in the grasp of the mest sinewy descendant of Brian Boru that ever bounded barefoot over a bog. I need scarcely say, Sir, that there ia no such barony as .Arderry in the west-. no such town as Letterbrick-no such chieftail1 as the Mulliga11 of Ballymulli­,gan-no s_uch peoplll as Messrs. Black aaj White ; but there are a baronyI a town, and people exactly like them, who are acting exactly in the manner I have described. If they court an inquiry, they shall h,i,ve every facility given them by me for it. I will supply names, dates, imd places, if they wish me to do so. I have the honour to remain, Sir, Your faithful servant, April 18. JACOB OMNIUM. No.1. 1'Jacob Omnium, .\gent for the British As­ sociation for the Helie£ of the Destitute Irish, to W. H. Black, Esq . Kildare. "" Letterbrick, April 11, 1847. "" Sir,-Having been commissioned by lhe British Association to accompany Mr. :!quills, R.M., a surgeon deputed by Government for the same purpose to Letterbrick, in Her Majestv's ship Horri­ble, conveying a cargo of seed to Mayo and Donegal, and to report to them the actual state of the people and the exer­tions which were being made by the landed proprietors to save them, I feel it my painful duty to call your attention to the miserable tenantry on your estates in Arderry. ""Theyare daily dying from sheer famine, imd rottini in the cabins where they die. "" They have none to look to for iid ; for if vou, who have for many years derived your resources hence, aban­don those whose labour has supplied those resources the moment they cease to be profitable to you for a time, you cannot expect that the charity of Eng­land can be extended to the tenants of men who themselves will not bestir them­selves to save them. ""Your agen~, Mr. White, aware of the arrival of the Horrible, and of the cargo which she brought, left Arderry the day she anchored in the bay, without making any arrangements for procuring seed for your people, and there is now no one in the country t.o represent your extensive property!here, or even to bear, personally, any share in the arduous task. uf dispensing .the funds which English public and private charity may devote to the relief of the diseased and starving poor on your estates.

To this letter Mr. Black returned an answer, saying that he had for 20 years watched anxiously over and devoted large sums of money to his tenantry in .A,rderry ; that his agent was a most able and respectable man, and did not deserve my censure ; that it was evident I had written my letter hastily ; that his own age and duties in Kildare prevented his attending personally to his estates in Arderry, but that Mr. White would im­ mediately return furnished with powers to co-operate with me in every practi­ cable manner. Mr. Black further informed me that for the last two years he had not received a farthing from his property here, and that the Government measures -amounting in his opinion to a confisca­ tion of bis estate-prevented his going to any expense about it. This, I believe to be a fair precis oj his letter. I have sent it to London, and cannot, therefore, publish it now; but, if he thinks I have garbled it, I will do so whenever he ;;ileases. No. 2. ""Jacob Omnium to W. H. Black, Esq. ""Aoril 16. "" Sir,-If you will re-read the letter which I had the honour of addressing you, you will see that J made no reflections whatever either on the manner in which you had thought fit to conduct your estates in Arderry in past years, or on the conduct of _your agent, of whom I knew nothing, save that he had made no arrangements for availing himself of the facilities which the Government and.the British Association had afforded you for supplying your tenants with seed. ' I have just had an interview with him. -He freely admits that the high price of provisions has rendered your tenants pennilesR, that tbey are daily dying of starvation, and that the only in­structions .he has received from you are to confine his expenditure for their relief 'to any sums he may henceforward wring from them. '' He corroborates the information which I had already received, that this town and about 60,000 acres of land, with a population of 12,000 souls, belong to you at a rent-roll of £2,500 a-year, part of which is from a year to a year and a half in arrear ; that in 1846 a sum of £70 was expended on your account in labour for your own benefit; and that since the 1st of January your charities over your entire property here are com­ prised in the sum of £15, granted to the soup kitchen of Letterbrick. ""Yesterday, at my own private ex­pens9, I had .the bodies of four of your tenants dragged out of their cabins, where they were breeding fever and pestilence, placed in coffins, and buried. Their wretched relatives had no money to purchase coffins, and were too weak to carry them to the grave. ' Mr. White since his return has met one of your people carrying on his back the corpse of his wife stuffed into a tish bas]rnt to the burial-ground. '' As you have supplied him with no funds, he can do nothing to alleviate this horrid misery ; and as you are not dis­poRed to provide seeds for your tenants, unless 'the English support them-not till harvest, for there wfll be no harvest, but for an indefinite period-they must all die.

Subsequently to my sending letter No. 2, Mr. White called upon me and men­tioned that Mr. Black had, in addition to the £70 disbursed in 1846, spent £200 on his estate that year ; but that since January he had, as I have stated, con tributed but £15 to meet the present crisis. He further said that Mr. Black did not clear more than £1,000 last year out of the property, (LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, APRIL 23, 1847.) , Where is the Irish malady to end 1 How far are the symptoms to rroceed before we can congratulate ourselves on arriving at the crisis of the disease f What new forms of moral or physical evil ara to be developed before we can ap­pr)llch its termination ? It is difficult for us, reposing in the tranquil contempla­tion of metropolitan wealth and general comfort, to realize the horrors which are tol~ us of that which is truly a great famine. It is only when some one habi­tuated to the luxury and opulence of England undertakes a pilgrimage of mercy to those shores of sickness and suffering that we are made sensible of the fearful visitation from which we are separated by so slight an interval. Then it is that.the enormity of what we escape and they endure is brought mor,e forcibl;y to our minds by the minuteness of detail which is in strong contra.st with. the generality of an account purely Irish. We then acknowledge the presence of a ~alamity more severe than famine, and a destroyer more cruel than the aphis oastator-a dearth of those virtues and n.ffections which enable men to brave national calamities witli serenity and suc­cess. In our columns of yesterday appeared a letter from a ,contributor whose playful satire has so often afforded amusement to our readers. But "" JACOB OMNIUM "" writes no longer from the palatial mag­nificence of Belgravia, The fears of Pro­tectionists and the treachery of PEEL are no longer the themes of his light and salient sarcasm. l<""rom the defence of civic and the assault of bucolic wealth his pen has strayed intothe portraiture of poverty unexampled not only in its severity but its helplessness. From an ironical cre­ dulousness of virtues monopolized by the agricultural interest, his mind's eye has travelled to the contemplation of a mean ness, a selfishness, and a heartlessness which none but a purelyagricultural class has yet exhibited, and that in one coun­ try of the world alone. We almost hope that his description is over-coloured by his imagination. We would disbelieve him in spite of our prejudices and our suspicions. We would fain hope thail others of that admirable band which has sallied forth on its crusade of charity to repay Celtic reproach by Saxon gene­ rosity could by their own experience con. tradict his assertions and resist hls de­ ductions. But these seem to harmonize too nearly with all that we have heard from other sources, and all that we daily read of published grievances, to admit of a doubt that they are in the main correct. .And what a state of things it is that ha. describes ! Corpses festering_together in ruined hovels, and breathing contagion on the survivors of the pestilence, or , crammed in baskets and hurried in the precipitation of unceremonious fear tG some unconsecrated grave; th~ people prostrated by disease, hunger, and panic I and in the midst of this great physical suffering, the graver moral evils, which are limited in their causes and effects to noone single period-apathy, indifference, cruelty, despair. While the many are perishing, the few are hoarding or ex­torting. While the desolation of one dearth is glutting unhallowed sepulchres with unpitied victims, the consequences of another are slighted and forgotten. While the famished mother bears on her shoulder the dead child whom hunger bas slain, the rich man shuts his pocket and the Union its door. While, too, all signs and suffering bid men frnr and guard against another unfruitful harvest, the ground remains untilled, the seed unsown, and the best bounty which policy could devise or charity dispense is unheeded and rejected! So strange, so wondrous, so incomprehensible is the complexity of Irish character and cala­mity, A vessel sails freighted with the produce of last harvest. It is besieged by expectant crowds. Its cargo is seized by the ravenous competition of starva­tion, or protected by the armR of a military force. But the seed which is to raise other harvests, and to supply future years, finds none to buy, and hardly any to beg it. So strong is the imperiousness of association,and so rooted the sense of a bad social system, that the people forbear to purchase the means of a future supply, because they fear it maybe distrained for rent ! ,. "" JACOB 0MNIUM "" may be unfortunate in.the scenes qf his visifa,tion. All placss l'Day not be like Letterbrick ; all land­lords may not be like the Mulligan. But why is it that in Ireland, and nowhere but in Ireland, events occur such as he wit­nesses, and men are found suoh as he paints 1 We believe, for our own parts, that there are no few good hmdlords in Ireland ; we also believe that there is no small viciousness in the peasantry. But why is it that the former are lost and buried in the general leaven of their class Y Why is it that the latter is so potent for mischief 1 This is only throwing the question a degree back. The condition of Ireland is not caused by the number of bad landlords or bad, tenants. It is caused by that neglectful and ins different state of things-that want of system-that absence of so.cial regulation """"'.""""without which the rich and the poor a're ever in a state of mutual hostility.fu Ireland the rich man has been taught to think that the peior man has no claim upon him. The poor man, neglected by the law, has learned to vindicate his rights by its infringement. The one extorts and oppresses, the other cheats or asaassinates. The worst effect, then, of a bad system is thus realized. The good suffer for the bad. The tenant, demoralized by a sanctioned iniquity, evades the payment of bis rent. His lessor treats his own landlord in the same way ; and thus many are deprived of the means of practising that charity which is at once congenial to their natures and accordant with their station. On the one hand, the peasantry, made callous by the affliction of one year and the in­justice of many, filch from their landlords their legal dues and from the land its natural tribute of labour, in order to transport the joint accumulations of fraud and imposture to some foreign shore or remote province. On the other, the land­lord, irritated by the pride of caste and the jealousy of covetousness, blinds his conscience to the wretchedness of his starved dependents, and while he stoops to solicit for his own kinsmen tir hous£­hold the degrading alms of English cha­rity, shuts his ear and his purse to the wail of destitute ~ndustry, to the rightful demands of the worn-out and infirm labourer, and th(cl plaintive supplication of orphan or widowed helplessness. If there is one class of human beings which more than any other should pray for a Poor Law with all their hearts and souls, it is that of the Irish landlords. The present state of things should be intolerable to them. They should not live one day more under its despotism, They should struggle to set themselves free as from an overwhelming burden of obloquy, infamy, and disgrace. No matter how good they may be individually, their class is branded with the stigma of a heartlessness hard as the nether mill­ stone. It may be often an unjust accu­ sation ; but it is one to which partly their own folly and partly the folly of the Legislature have exposed them. They have lived a:rid do live in a state of S'.lcicty which recognizes no <lependenc3 of poor on rich ; no claims of poverty on pro perty; no duties of the few to the many. When this license is guaranteed, is it not natmal that many should avail them­ selves of it i When they do so, is it not intelligible that the reputation of their class should suffer for it 1 And when-in addition to this-some of their body, instead of helping by their means or suffering in company with these by whose labour they have been supported, come forward crouching and cringing to the voluntary agent of English charity for a sop of his eleemosynary sporflula, is it Iwhich has made one class of Iri11hmen at strange that English indi!!llation should once mean and oppressive, while it has kirldled at this shamelessness, and made the other helpless as slaves and should denounce that miserable system reckless as savages 1 be The following is a letter from an officer of the Board of Works in Ireland, lately employed on a tour of inspection :­ "" I have just returned to Dublin, after having again visited the counties of Lime­rick and Clare .in the execution of my public duties. Upon the whole, the aspect of things was better than I expected to have found, and I hope we have seen the worst in this unfortunate country, although there are many difficulties yet to be overcome by the executive officers of the Govunment, and much privation still to be endured by the people, before a wholesome state of things comes round. In iny former letters, I remarked on the tillage of the land, and on several occasions I stat(!ld my opinion that culti­vation was carried to a greater extent than bad been generally admitted to be the case. Subsequent observations con­tinue to confirm me in that belief. With the exception of a small district to the west of Erris, where the land seemed scarcely suited, from its poverty, to any cultivation, I saw no signs whatever of neglect. On the contrary, there is un­doubtedly more land in tillage than usual. Between Limerick and Kilmallock, a distance of 20 miles, I could see but nine fields which were neglected, and even these may yet be ploughed. Not that the land has, I believe, been so well laboured as heretofore ; less manual labour has boon expended upon it-the plough has not gone so deep-the fields have not been dug-in many places the surface has been only scratched, and oats have been sown in wheat stubbles, con­trary to all approved principles of farming ; but much meadow land has been turned up and sown. I have seen gentlemen's lawns ploughed, and, in short, the'breadth of land in wheat, oats, and barley far exceeds what the most. sanguine person could. have anticipatei three months ago. Moreover, I have reason to believe tha;t this is generally the case throughout Ireland. Of course t~ere are exceptions, but I doubt that","(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 1847.)",3,4/22/1847
"CONDITION OF CLARE AND LIMERICK. (MONDAY, MAY 3, 1847.) even these exceptions are so numerous as have been stated. I have just beeD. informed, by a gentleman whom I-hold in estimation, that what I have said is true as regards .Antrim, arid along the whole line of road between Dublin and Belfast, which he has just travelled. Except in wild, poor, and mountainous districts, where the holdings are very small, and nothing but the potato and a few oats were produced by spade-labour the land has not been allowed to remain waste. Strange as it may sound at this time of . scarcity, I may say that it is not at.all impossible that, before the expiration of anoth3r year from this time, if we hav(i an abund.ant harvest., if Indian corn con­tinu1?s to be poured into the country, and the people become accustomed to it, to cook it properly and to like it, as is pro­bable-for it is what they term strong food as well as cheap-the farmers in Ire land may be loudly complaining that they cannot pay their rents in consequence of not being able to obtain a profitable price for their corn. "" I was quite surprieed to find so much land in preparation for potatoes. Between Limerick and Kilmallock I counted 53 men and women in 32 different fields "" setting "" them. This, howe,er, con­veys but an imperfect notion of the extent of what is doing in this respect, because there were many fields eithe~ sown or ready to be sown with potatoes in which no p.eople were atwork, and where plough ing was going on I could not tell what was intended to be put into the ground. It is impossible to estimate the pronor tion of the potato seed sown or likely to be sown in ratio to other years. A farmer near N enagh told me he counted on an eighth in his neighbourhood, but I think this is an over-estimate. In some places it may prove a tenth ; probably, on the whole, it will not be. beyond a fifteenth. None, however, can' form a reasonable guess, as the greatest pains were taken by those who possessed the seed to hic:la it from their 11.eighbours. Some buried.A under the floors of their cabins ; othel'S hid it a,;lay in turf clamps, andthe farmer whom I have just mentioned told me be knew instances of the seed being ]Jitted in a field, and corn sown over it to pre­vent any suspicinn being entertained of its being there. Now, how,wer, it is appear­ing in unexpected quantities. May not this in some measure iiccount for the othErwise unaccountable refurnl of parties to _put into the grounri turnip, parsnip, and other seed given to them by their landlords 1 The potato seed which has been set is universally in good condition-superior l;o any planted for above seven years, and far superior, 1 have been told, to that of fast year. The shoots are firm and healthy, whereas 0f late year, the shcots 9f this season have been long and feeble -what the country folks call ' stags.' You remember that last year's crop was blighted in the course of f.wo nights, !;luring which time the air was full of ~lectricity. People observed on the un­µsu:.i.l quantity of lightning. Now, it may lrave.been that the elentricity took eff€Ct 9n the potatoes with the weak shoots­jhe_ ' stags '-whereas if the shoots had been_ firmer and more healthy, as they l,ll'e this year, the blight might not have been so general. Much foreign se€d has boon introduced, likewise .in a promising state and at a moderate price. Twelve days ago some very good were soJd at the quay at Limerick at 10d. per stone, which, considering all things, is wonderfully {pw. Tbe wheat is looking well. There has been a run on sowing barley latkrly,and farmers are sanguine as to its turn­ing out profitably. Grass is backward. Cattle and pigs are very dear. Three t,olerably good milch cows fetched £20 a piece at Ennis market the week before last. "" The late rednotion in the price of food has already diminished the suffer­jngs of tlie poor, though .the fall in the ::wboleea.le price of t,he imported corn has not yet produced an adequately corre­lJponding effect on rAtail business. Indian ~ea], however, was b'eing sold last week jn Ennis at the retail shops at 2s., and had bee-n sold the week before as low as ]B. 9d. per stone, which for some time p~viously stood at 2s. 4d. and even reached 2s. 9d. I found apprehensions f)ntertained of the supply from America not being continued, and consequently (If a return to higher prices. These apprehensions, certainly fostered by the ho_lders of corn, who in many instances bave been urging the committees to pur­ chase largely now, have liad the effect of keeping up prices. The people do not appear to have yet got into the way of cooking the Indian meal sufficiently. They consume it in too raw a state. Som~ of them, however, mix it with oatmeal in egual parts ; they use the mixture in the form of porridge, and find it whole­some. "" I had an opportunity of Aeeing som~ of the working of the new relief system at Newmarket-on-Fergus, in the county of Clare-the only place, I believe, where it has come fairly. h1to operation. The works being stopped in this district, in consequence of the attack made some time ago on Captain Fishbourne, the inspecting officer, the extreme wants oi the people stimulated the committees to exert themselves to the utmost. Relief in food has been given for a month, and, so far, the trial, I understand, has been successful. Those in urgent distress, and with large [families, attend for their daily dole of Indian meal, bnt those who are not in such distress, and who have not such large families, are not disposed to attend in the same manner. The relieJ in proportion to destitution is given more equally than was the case under tl::e, system of working on the roads. For instance, every individual of a family of eight, if in want, can obtain a certain portion of £cod, whereas probably only one, or two at most, were employed on the roads, earning less than the value of what they now receive ; and a family of two, or even three, with one of them on the public 'works, received more money in reference to number than the value of what they now obtain. Less money will be spent in whisky. Moreover, it is a cheaper mode of relief, ,and it by no means opens a door to jobbing, as did the works. How it may answer in densely­populated districts, or where there may be a deficiency of eligible persons to con­stitute efficient relief committees, yei remains to be seen ; but I confess that 1 entertain a beUer opinion of it now_ that I have seen something of its working thaD I did some time back. "" I do not know if you have received any detailed account Qf the attack made on Captain Fishbourne in Newmarket, which caused the stopp!l.!re of the works: in the neighbourhood. 'i introduce it here to show what an excitable and un­reasoning assembly a mob is-not that any additional proofs of this are wanting. "" Captain F1shbourne arrived in the district as inspecting officer just when the orders to reduce the number of persons on the public works were about to be carried into effect, and doubtless he per­formed his duty with stringency. Several works ceased at the same period, from the money presented having been ex­pended ; consequently many were thrown out of employment, and the blame was laid by them on Captain Fishbourne. Sir Lucius O'Brien, Mr. R. Studdert, of New­market, a magistrate of the county, and Captain F1shbourne, were in the Sessions, house at Newmarket, which looks upon a large, open space in the town. The place was crowded with men, chiefly from the district east of Newmi.rket, in a state of fury, armed with sticks, and many of them, as afterwards appeared, with stones in their pockets. Captain Fishbourne was recommended to get away as quietly and as secrectly as possible ; but he did not conceive there was any danger,and boldly went into the crowd. A cry was raised among them that he was an Englishman, who, having starved the people in Skib­l;>ereen, was sent into Clare by the c;}overnment, with a salary of £500 a year, to s 1uve them also, How this i,'trango report got abroad no one appears to know. But its effects WP,re terrific. $ir Lucius O'Brien and Mr. Studdert at once saw his danger. Mr. Studdert took him by the arm, and Sir Lucius followed him as closely as possible to prevent him from being struck from behind. The mob, shouting and yelling, crowded in upon them, and evid1mtly tried to force him towards a small stream, lined with masonry, where the poor people w.,re in the habit of washing their clothes. If they had once got him into it, nothing would have saved him, but Sir Lucius and Mr. Studdert succeeded in keeping him off. Foiled in their purpose, the fury of the people increased; they mobbed him effectually, tore his thick great coat to shreds, knocked off his hat, and cut his head. At last one man twisted his hand in his neckcloth and almost str~-ngled him. He was so closely pressed upon that he could not raise his hands to free himself, and he was sinking. Mr. Studdert per­ceived the danger, but neither could he get his hands up, from the pressure of the crowd. There was nothing else for it ; Mr. Studdert laid hold of the fellow's fist with his teeth, and bit him to. the bone. .Another instant and Captain Fishbourne would have fallen never to have risen a.live, but Mr. Studdert's teeth savedhim. The man relaxed his grasp. The mob ~hen opened a little, some of the police appeared, Captain Fishbourne contrived to get on his car, which was in front, and the <lriver succeeded in pmhing on, clearing the crowd, and reaching the police station. Sir Lucius O'Brien and Mr. Studdert both thought at one time that Captain Fishbourne's chance of escape was gone, and certainly without their protection he would have been sacrificed-sacrificed to the extraordinary report that he was the man who destroyed the people at Skiblereen. "" 'lhe farmers are not employing the labourers, and in this respect there are very contradictory reports. The farmers say the men will not W,)rk for them at all -that they have been demoralized by the public works. By the bye, that expres­sion of the people being "" demoralized by the public works "" has b£come a regula1 catchword tl1rouel10ut the country-all hands make use of it whether they under­stand its meaning or not. On the othm hand, the labourers say the farmers will not hire them at any price. If it were, possible to decide the quest.ion, which ii is not, I believe it would be found that blame rested with thefarmers rather than with the labourers. Much discuntent pre0 vails among those who have been remuved from the works by the late reductions. It could not be otherwise, and the most discontent is shown by those who are least deserving of relief, especially by those who were improperly rlaced on the fo;ts. This ji>bbing has attracted great attention and met with deserved repro­ bation in England. It. is generally attri bnted to t.he gentry and the relief com mittees. But though these rarties have, in repeated ins ancES, I must acknow ledge, followed a highly discreditable co.urse, and evinced a singular misl!,ppre hension of the principles by which they ou,;bt .to have been actuated, yet more blame has been cast upon them than, I think, on the whole they deserve. The great extent to which jobbing went in this respect has been perpe1rated by overseers and persons of that description. "" From the different opinions I heard expressed I gathered that, however in­dividual pers)LS or indfridual places may have been affected by the late reductions on the works, the decided steps taken by the Government have met with general approbation among the better classes, inasmuch as relief committees have been stimulated to exert themselVEs bv the pressure upon tl em by the poor people of their immediate nei~hbour!Dods. It is fortunate, too, that the works have been stopped, for the present at least, though many of the roads are left in a . dangerously unfinished state. A great deal of money will be required to put them in reasonable order, to say nothing of what it would be necessary to expend if they were to be finished in the Jnanner originally intended by the en­gineers and sub-engineers who laid them out. The fury of the mobs coerced the presentment sessions into passing all that came before them, and the necessity of :finding labour in the distressed districts forced on works which would not have been undertaken in ordinary times. Not having time to consider maturely how they (the roads) ought to have been laid out, the engineers hurried into the exe­cution of them irrespective of the pro­bable cost. The subject seems to me to be one of moment, and it is my opinion that only those works should be completed which are clearly indispensable to the general communications of the country ; that they should be executed at the smallest cost with reference to common safety, either by rigid task-work or by contract, leaving the remainder to be dealt with by the several grand juries, to finish or not, wholly or partially,. as the exigencies of. -the various localities may require."" ----~",CONDITION OF CLARE AND LIMERICK.,1,5/3/1847

"(LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1847.) H The Poor Law for Ireland is passed. Otherwisethe prospectweregloomyindeed. All else that concerns that unhappy island is flat and st;ale. Every fact that is chronicled is already anticipated. Any comment that may be made is already on the tongue. If we tum from the general condition which is recorded in our columns of people clamouring for food, or dying from pestilence, to the details which are furnished by private accounts, we find little to console, and nothing to encourage us. While actual famine-which exists in spite of unparalleled bounty-has been confined to the very poor, and the most helpless of the very poor, disease and death have stormed the houses of the affluent and the well-to-do. Terror lias added wings to despair. The sight of suffering unexampled and undiminished -the wearisome monotony of woe--the revulsion which throws the, mind back i_hto other and happier scenes-all these afe driving away the few whose means would suffice to ward off :extreme priva­tfon. 'l'be families of the gentry and the middle classes are leaving the isl11nd, and flying to England, to Wales, or to Scot­land. With 'theso depart the last natural hopes, the last natural stay of Ireland. A few months more of an emigration like this, and a new element will be added to 'the perplexities of politics. A new body will demand relief, and clamour for assist­ ance. While tbe Irish peasantry are the objects of national bJJnnty and the subjects of legislative anxiety, the Irish gentry will email, another care, but in !J. different shape from any that has hitherto bEten .suggested-or dreamed of. Instead tJf iooJdng out a colony for the lowest of the Celtic population, it will be necessary to tind one for their gentry and their middle classes. Already people speak seriously of such an emigration, its diffi­ culties and its advantages. No mode of speech could so strongly point the magni­ tude of the Irish dilemma. At such a crisis the New Irish Poor Act has been consummated. At such a crisis, too, appears the protest of Lords CL.AN CARTY, MONTEAGLE, and MoUNTC.ASHELLj on bringing up the report. As all these are Irish landlords-and all have been resident landlords-we felt no slight curiosity to see the reasons by which they justify their rancorous but fruitless perse­cution of the obnoxious Bill. Not satis­fied with having resisted it while there yet remained a chance of victory, why do they now, in this supreme hour of its triumph and their own defeat, persist in the exhibition of an insatiate spite ? One of thi,se noble Lords, in addition to being an Irish proprietor, bas been an English legislator for 27 years, was a member of l<]nglish Administrations for some 10 or 12 years of tha~ time, and has taken part in every decate that Ireland has given rise to within the period of his public life. We are naturally solicitous to peruse the reasons which weigh with a person who should have learnt something by so much expArience. The first two reasons amount to this­that because the discretionary power or granting out-door relief has never existed heretofore, it should not exist now ; and that its recipients will be better provided for than the labouring man, &c. In faJt, it is the old story. They reason as if the present imperfect system of the Irish Poor Law was the very be,st thing in the world-as if no improvement on it were( feasible or conceivable. But they are_ blind to the facts, the-almost incredible, facts, of this very year; They forget thafl in the year of redemption 1847, faniine and pestilence came suddenly on a whole nation, and found its poor utterly unpro­vided with any relief but that of the newly-erected workhouses-the work­houses unable to contain a tithe of the applicants ; that while in the hutTy-scurry of calamity means were being contrived to satisfy an unwonted demand, thou­sands perished, whom a milder and more reasonable law might have kept alive ; that the dying and the dead lay together in their cabins, breathing infection on the helpless survivors ; that more severe than physical want or physical suffering was the pressure of doubt, distrust, and dismay upon a people for whom the law had established no provision- who had no claim on human being or human chattel for support in the last agony of their affliction ; that at this moment dis­affection and insubordination, produced l,y this moral infection, are raging in the cities of Ireland. They shut their eyes to the one great and pervading elEment of all Irish questions-viz., the effect of a long and lamentable misgovernment on the character of th& Irish people. They forget that, whatever that may havo been in their indigenous state, it has received no encouragement from laws and legislators. It has not known the foster­ing care of provident governors or gene­rous benefact:Jrs. No kindlv code has mitigated its asperities, correcte<l its peccant humours, or soothed its erring waywnrdness. Legislation has played with it, and petted, not fostered and caress,id it. English principles and insti­tutions have been thrown at random among them, not as things intended to fructify, but as bones of contention to instruments of quarrel. This oversight runs through all thE> objections to the Poor Law, as it runs through this protest. .An experiment is denounced as perilous, because it ought not at this day to be merely an experiment. The protestors forget its danger, and terrors are only owing to its having been staved off so long. Viewed with reference to principles, these protests only reflect discredit on England for her ill policy, her neglect, her dilatoriness ; viowed in connexion with details, upon their authors only. They object to one set of provisions, when the very faults with which they ~barge them are obviated by another to which they alsJ object. This is perhaps tpo broadly stated. Let us be just, Lord (/LANCARTY is the only protestor who has 'been able to swallow all the items of the document to wllich he puts his name. He objects therefore at the same time to the scheme of outdoor relief as making the idle poor too comfortable, and also to the elause which limits the chances of that relief by increasing the number of ex officio guardians ; he objects, in the same breath, to the plan as being too popular and too despotic. The other Peers who sign this protest do not go so far ~ this ; they quietly shut their eyes to a sentence of which they cannot but see the contra­diction and the absurdity. But they no less .shut their .eves to the fact which it embodies , and the"" general fact which it Ieavei;unnoticed. They blind themselves to the universal laws of human conduct and the invariable effects of certain con­ditions. They forget that receiving implies giving:;, that. however ready one class of men may be to receive, the othe? will be proportionately reluctant to give ; that not only guardians, but ratepayers of every degree, have a common interest in refusing relief to the unworthy ; and that the whole plan of a Poor Law is one of reciprocal duties. The man who can just scrape a subsistence together, afier paying his rent, will be careful not to pay to any one who can do without it ; and this i11disposition and the general poverty of the country will disable those who can work from getting relief without giving work in return Truly, the New Poor Law is an experi­ment' ; an 1:>xperiment the more danger­ous because long delayed. To defer it was impossible. It would only be to accumulate . a catalogue of calamities almost beyond conception and certainly beyond cure. It must be tried, and tried fairly, come what will of it. Duty, Justice, Mercy, imperatively demand this; and no more hopeful season than this could rresent itself for a fair trial. The melancholy death of the late respected VICEROY has devolved an office, formerly honorary, but now the most onerous in the Administration, on one whose sense of its responsibilities will not allow him to slumber at his post. To Lord CLAREN­DON the Lieutenancy of Ireland will be no useless pageant, no trapping of idle state, but a high magistracy, employing a watchful vigilance and a jealous control, For this he has abandoned a department more congenial to his tastes and far more consistent with his ease. For this he has given up much that makes office desirable, to men of his position .and years, at a time which exacts more than usual judg­ment and more than usual firmness. Lord CLARENDON has been no late or un, willing convert to the doctrines of the Irish Poor Law; he will lend no reluctant and frigid aid to its administration ; he will not sneer it down by well-timed ad­mission of its difficulties, nor unite him­self at an awkward crisis to its open and bitter foes. So far, the prospect is favour­able,","(LEADING ARTICLE, WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 1847.)",2,5/19/1847
"SUBSIDENCE OF THE DISTRESS. (LEADING ARTICLE, SATURDAY, AUGUST 14, 184'7.) The people of England are not wanting either in charity or in patience, but we are sure they would all think it high time the Commissioners for Irish Relief should close their account. By the end of Sep­tember, the latest period to be allowed even for the worst conditioned districts, it will have been full two years since Ire­land was put under the system of extra­ordinary relief. After two successive failures of the staple crop this is not too much ; but with a good harvest actually under the sickle, with food no longer at famine prices, and with an unusual de­mand for labour, there can be no reason for suffering this enormous account still to run on. Of course indolence, or cupidity, or possibly a still more discreditable motive, can always suggest to the recipients of charity that they pave a claim to its further continua11ce. Where you have to deal .with the sluggish and d~sponding, and where the moral is that they are to sit still and do nothing while the State puts into their mouths the bread of the indnstrfous, the vis inertire of human nature is sure to back your-advice. Nothing is so easy as to go on for ever giving what is not your own. To this day, or at least till the other day-for we think Hul!rn stopped it at last-we were maintaining the widows and children of the French Protestant ministers who fled hither after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Let extraordinary relief go on a month longer than necessary, and it becomes a vested interest. Even a beggar's walk !)an be sold. Continue rations for a year, and Irish property will rise in the market. The fain~est prospect of legislative assistance will susp.end the auctioneer's hammer, and reward him with one more bidding. We presume that when the industrious inhabitants of this island made shift to carry Ireland through the famine, they did not contem­plate that their charity wot1ld be coolly discounted and negotiated in the market by landlords and land jobbers. So it is high time the affair should be wound up. We are quite aware that there are cir­cumstances under which the cessation of extraordinary relief on any plea whatever would be a mere mockery of distress. To tell a starving man that he must starve because he has returned to his normal state, which happened to be one of star­vation1 would be a cruel jest. But while we have propped up the nation with tem­porary measures, Ne have taken the oppor­tunity of presenting to it a permanent in­stitution of charity. Ireland has now a. real Poor Law. Every man, woman, and child struck off the extraordinary relief list can go to the relieving-officer of the union and claim supporl from the local proprietors. In fact, the Irishman has now the same chance as the Englishman in this respect. The English pauper does not dream of extraordinary relief ; nor. does he ask the clergy to put their heads together and send a howl to the news­. papers. The English landowner, when he finds a few dozen poor creatures pressing on his resources, does not make out a. case for Parliament or the Treasury. No; the poor man gees to the parish, and thel -comparativelv rich< man pays the just, debt of charity without more ado. I:f6: pays the debii to the uttermost farthing,' even though:: the outgoings of his pr9perty, may be actually exceeding Jhe incomings. i He must pay it. He knows that he hasi no escape. The Irish proprietor must now, do the same. Yet one of the pleas urged uponthe Relief, Commissioners to induce them to con-' thme their rations, is, "" That the Poor: Law guardians l1ave no funds.'' _Were the: plea once allowed, we .may be sure the Poor Law guardians throughout the; whole island would take very good care; to be always without funds. Iri England: we do not consider w ant of funds a sufli~. cient reply to the demands of a creditor.: The debtor mllst either meet his social obligations or resign his whole statusin society. He must give up the inheritance of his fathers, the mansion which he has built with his money and adorned with. 'his taste, his sweet pleasure grounds and gardens, every curve of which has been traced with his eye and his pen, his heir­loom~, his furniture, his jewels, his library, and even the portraits of his illustrious ancestors, though they seem to live again in his features-he must part with everything, and quit for ever his much-cherished home, a poor but honest man. BetweenrrJperty and its dutiea in thts island mercy is utterly unknown. The law has not an atom of comuunction. n2 It exacts to the uttermost farthing. If one _proprietor cannot pay the debt, another can. The same rule must and shall be established in Ireland. They tell us that there are parishes where the wholA produce of the land is insufficient to the maintenance of the poor. We tlo not believe it. But at anv rat,e the ex­periment must be tried. Let the whole produce be seized. When that is done, and when all the crops have passed through the books of the parish or union, we shall then be in better condition to ascertain the ratio which the rescurces of the soil bear to the population upon it. .. We mean what we say; and are in­different to the canting charge of in­human;ty which the landowners and the landowners' scribes will be sure to bring against us. Tha utter sacrifice and sur­~nder of property to its charitable obli­gations is by no means so uncommon as it may seem. Thousandti of yeoman and t'enant fa1wers in this island have been reduced to beggary by the payment of poor's-rates. We do not say that poc-r's­ra.tes were the sole or the necessary cause of their ruin ; but we do say that when, after lives of industry and competence, they found themselves aged and penni­less, they would have been wealthy men if they cculd have recovered the sums they had paid to the overseer. Perhaps they might haye 1t1anaged with a little mere thrift--perhaps they inight have scraped 'lip their quota for the rate-book by the savings of the larder or the beer cellar, or by some other painful denial. But so it was. The poor's-rate was just the last ounce that broke their b:.cks. After £100 for rent and £20 for tithe, £30 for the poor took the wind clean out of them, and kept them continually froundering from one scrape into another. We rave no wish to see.any cla-ss of Iribh proprie­tors or tenants floundering further or deeper thau they no1l are. We only say that if they find themselves compelled to practise the most rigid economy, or even to sutfer great loss for the sake of the poor, they are only in circumstanc s with which we are very famil;ar in this country. But there is a still commoner and still more painful case. In this metropolis are many thousand occupiers of very humble tenements, living by precarious employments with severe toil, and iu the midst of very great discomforts. Instead of blue sky and the balmy gales of spring, they dwell 1mder a canopy of smoke, and breathe a poisonous and stenchy atmo­sphere that taints the blood and sinks the soul. They would rather live brnide heather and bog, but the calls of duty and the necessities of life compel them to seekemployment where it is to be fcund. Now, of these many thousands, nearly all, however poor .themselves, contribute to the main1enance of the poor. The invalid many weeks iri arrears, the widowed mother that toils all c!r.y at tl:e washing-tub or all night at the shirt, the struggling mechanic, and the pensioned solitary, must meet the demands of the quarterly collector. Though they go without bread for it themselves, and see their little ones cry for food, they mu.st and do pay. In failure thereof they must part with the bed on which they lie, and, eventually, the house itself in respect of which the demand is made. In behalf of these many thou.sands, we peremplorily insist on it that the Irish propriet.ors and tenants shall have the self-same measure of duty, and shall maintain their poor to the very last farthing in their pockets and the last rood of their estates. Other­wise it m11i;t inevitably and speedily c me to this most iniquitous and intolerahle result~that the overworked and hard­pressed ratepayers and faxpayers of this , metropolis and of this country will have to maintain not only their own poor, Lut also the four million paupers of Ireland.",SUBSIDENCE OF THE DISTRESS,2,8/14/1847
"CLOSING OF THE RELIEF FUND. (LEADING ARTICLE, TUESDAY,. Auous r 24, 1847.) The day is now rapidly drawing near when the Relief Fund will cease to be -available in aid of any one electoral divis'on throughout Ireland. C'!i the 15th of the present month the names of many were struck out of the lists of the Relief Commissioners. On Sunday next still more will follow ; and on Sun,fay fortnight not even Skibbereen will be entitled to further assistance. From the 12th of September next Ireland must swim alone, the Irish poor must be , up­ported by the Irish soil. There should be nothing disheartening in this proposition for men who are worthy of the' name. It is sufficiently evident to the eye of any intelligent observer, that throughout those districts of Ireland from which the loudest complaints are likely to arise the soil is at this moment but in a state of half cultivation. Tako Clare, take Galway-pass up through Mayo to Donegal, walk through-large portions of Limerick and Kerry, and compare the state ofcnltivation th-ere existing with that of soils< £ similar fertility m England and in Scotland. what is the reasr,n of the~ difference 1 Protestant ascendency, an­swers the priest--Raxon -oppression roars out the well-fed Repealer-while the .l{ibandman, as he takes a snap-shot in ihe dusk of the evening at his employer, thinks it strange that capi al will not remain in the country. 'Jhere is, how­ever, anotl1er and a better reason behind, which is just this-the predecessors of the now nominal owners of the soil were a thriftless and improvident r.ice, and the present generation must ray not only for their own manifold transgressions and shortcomings but for those of their an­cestors. At this very moment a large number of them are living beyond their mrnus. They not only have nothing, but _they are deeply involved be,sides ; and yet they consider it a hardship that the Imperial Treasury will not furnish thBm with the means of continuing a style of expenditure which is utterly inconsistent wi:h their real condiiion. We are fully aware that the usual answer to this is, that the affliction which has fallen on Ire­land in ihe year 1846-47 has been a special visitation of PROVIDENCE-unexpected in origin, dreadful in effect, sweeping in ex­tent. It is as though the windows of Heaven had been once more opened to sweep away not a people, but the only means on which that people could rely for support. \Ve grant most readily that which it would be affectation to deny, with the fifth report of the Relief Com­missioners before us, that the root which has been the main staple of subsistence for the Irish people was, in the last year, mainly destroyed. From that s,mrce.we learn that at the beginning of July up­wards of three millions of persons were supp rted on daily rations afforded by the public bounty, while, op_ the 3d of August, more than two millions and a half had still no other means of subsist­en~e. The fact, however, of the destruc­tion of the potato is quite beside the. real merits of the question. The real point is, Who brought the great bulk of the Irish people to rely upon that root for support 1 By whose act did it happen, that while in tlther countries of Europe land and labour were settling themselves down into their natural relA,tions, Ireland alone presented us with the phenomenon of an unemployed peasantry and an untilled soil? There have been Irish landlords who were a credit to their country-men worthy, in every sense, of the position they were called to occupy. The white list at the present day is, we believe, still morn numerous. But, when we have made every necessary abatement, it stiU remains ft htmentable truth, tr.at the prime cause why the Irish peasantry have been reduced Lo their present level mu11t be sought for in the l1eglect and unthrift of past generations of claret-drinking; writ-despising landlords. That is at least one reas,,n why the Irish peasant is tlw worst-fed, worst-clothed, worst-housed ma_n, in Europe ; fed upon Jumpers, clothed in tatters, housed in a hovel which l1e dares scarcely thatch, lest the torch of the in­cendiary should be applied to it at mid. night. That is the reason why bogs have remained undrained, acres untilled, _ang waste lands out of cultivation. Witb the operation of the Puor Law -will commence a new era for ]j:el-.ml. Up till harvest-time three millions of persrns will have been supported on public rations, who, after the sickle bas done its work~ must fall back for suppor,t on the produnts of their own soil. The landlords can no longer flinch from tI:e obligation, Evictions of tenantry rave had -their day, but that system, at least, will no...J.onger avail. If proprietors in Roscommon shall think fit to turn their arable land, now let in small holdings, into pasture, wit,h no holdings at all, they are welcome to ,vork their pleasnrti, There is just thisdiffe: ence between their past and present condition,-formerly they would turn tlieir cot.tiers out to <'ie upon the roadside, now they must make a rate for their support in the union workhouse. \Ve would have them for their own sakes to understand thus much, that they may take their measures in time-that, come ill, come good, this law will be left to its natural opera icn. It is in Yain frr them to look for furlh r aid or subsidy to this side of the Cbannol. All that-we could do we haYe done d~ ready. Despite of all the obloqu}'. and abuse of which we have been the obJects, we say it in sorrow, not in anger, hence,. forth they must help themselves. We 11,re not even disposed to rake up the recent grievances of the abuse of the relief funds, although we see by the minute of the Commissioners that Irish­men there have been who have driven an unholy traffic in the misery of their coun­ .trymen. We are most lrnppy to give all publicity to the fact that the Commis­sioners speak of this abuse as being far from universal, and acknowledge in suit­able terms the zealous co-operation of the Relief Com!Jlittees in the various districts of the conntry. The question of the Poor Law and of the absolute necessity of submitting to ibs provisions is, we take it, for Irish landlords just now the matter of most vital importance. Another question bas, however, been raised, as to the time and mode of repayment of the money advanced to the different unions under the Relief Ar.t. We published yesterday the pro­ceedings of the Board of Guardians for the union of Fermoy; who hail been called together, under a requisition from the Poor Law Commissioners, to levy an additional rate to repay the advances under t,he Temporary Relief Act. The­sums advanced by the Relief Commission are referred to various heads. There are donations in aid of local subscriptions ; there are grants in aid of rates ; finally, there are loans .on the credit of rates. It is with regard to a loan under this last head that the discussion arose at the Board of Guardians for the union of Fermoy. We find this union debited in the account of the Commissioners ivr a loan of £23,829 12s. 5d., and it was for the return of this money that application was made. Some were for making a rate to repay the loan ; others for paying it by instalments ; others for not paying it at all ; while Lord MopNTCASHELL, with his usual na,ivete, stated his opinion, that if ihey once commenced to pay, even by instalments, they would be opening the door to exactions which would finally ~rind them down into the dust. The discussion altogether took a turn to which we have not been unaccustomed from an Irish deliberative assembly. Mr. Roc1rn, who seemed to have forgotten altogether the sums that had been dis­bursed from the Imperial Treasury for the relief of Irish distress, was of opinion that if the Fermoy union repaid this loan, it would be calling on Ireland to tax herself solely for the relief of Irish calamity. He proposed to call togdher all the Poor Law guardians of the county of Cork, in order that they might adopt one uniform mode of action for repu­diating their debts in a body. Mr. CAR­ROLL, with some pretensions to sense and honesty, rderred to Lord JonN RusSELL's declaration on the 25th of June, to the effect that arrangements should be made by Parliament by which, in each suc­ceeding year, money advanced to the Irish landlords should be repaid by in­stalments, and when each instalment be came due, upon one-half being paid, the other. half should be remitted, t>tking care that the whole debt was kept up till that half was paid. Without stopping to inquire too curiously how far Lord JOHN RusSELL's declaration was applicable to the rate in question, we are content to accept even this desire to meet an obligation as evi­dence of a better state of things. In no instance, we hope, will the loan be re­mitted ; but, at the same time, there is"" no doubt that, as to the mode of repay­ment, a certain regard will be had to the cii::cumstances of each particular union. There is so deep an anxiety to give the landlords a fair chance with the New Poor Law (which will most assuredly be worked in its full rigour), that every con­sideration which is consistent with the exact repayment of the loans will, we trust, be shown them in other respects. The present crisis is the turning point of the future destiny of the landlords of Ireland. The. burden of practical proof is thrown upon theIJ). to show that the country can support their class.",CLOSING OF THE RELIEF FUND,2,8/24/1847
"MAGNITUDE OF RELIEF OPERATIONS. (LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, AFGUST 26, 1847.) We publish to-clay a letter from an.eye-drawn from a large section. The whole witness of one of the most important scheme by which human society is else­epochs in Irish history. For months and where regulated, the laws of economic months the great mass of a nation had science, the relations between capital and been supported by the public bounty, and labour, had in these instances been prac­on a particular day that support was with-tically annulled. Without effort or exer tion on their own part, as each succeeding day came round, they found prepared fer them the means of sustenance. The pittance might be $lender, the provision mean, but it was sufficient to keep body and soul together, and tbat was all to which they had been accustomed in their best days. As a mere question of quan­tity and quality of food, they had not been reduced below their usuai level ; the only differenc0 between their pa.st and present condition was this-now they might dismiss all thoughts of the morrow. While they slept, the Mini&ters and official persons who were daily held up to execration by their Rpiritua1 and poli­tical pastors were anxious and afoot. While Archbishop M'H.ALE was launch­ing an anathema against the Saxon, Sir O. Woon and Mr. LABOUCHERE were busy with the more prosaic, but not less useful task, of arranging the most effec­tive means of feeding the hungry popula­tion of Ireland. Three .millions of persons fed upon rations supplied by public bounty ! The fact is witbout a parallel in history. When the brilliant rhetoricians of Oonciliation­hc1ll, and of that oth<;ir nondescript assembly for which as yet no apt name hag been devised, make an excursion into t,he regions of history, let them not forget the history of their own time. The heroes of Clontarf and rara, if such there were, have found their match in the Re­lief Commissioners and Boards of Guar­dians. vVe do not inean to deny the clain,s to respect of FINGAL and BRIAN BoROIHME, but, without plucking one shamrock from their chaplets, we trust to see the names of BURGOYNE, REDINGTON, and RouTH come in for their fair share of laudatory hyperbole. Take the case of any army under the strictest discipline-­say an effective force of forty or fifty thousand men, and the despatches and letters of the most successful commam1ers inform us that their chief difficulty was in organizing a commissariat. Read the despatches of MARLBOROUGH,or the nohle records which the, Duke of WELLINGTON has left us of bis Penimmlar career, and, for once that you will find either General occupied in ranging his me11 in the field for some great military achiAvement, in nine instan<'es you will find him anxious and o~cupied in providing them with imitable food and raiment. But what a drop of water in the c-cean was the body of men for which either had to provide when compared with the3,000,000 9f Irish, men, women, and children, who, by the beneficent and unexampled exertions o:f the Legislature and the Government, have been matched from the jaws of famine and the gates of death. \Ve will leave the Irish agitators to their own reflections on the subject. Every re­proach, 1wery invective they utter, in the presence of this great fact, will be trum­pet-tongued for their own dishonour and confusion. The eifort was, however, too stupendous to last. Had it possessed tho character of permanence it would have ceased to be that which it was--almost a miracle. For the sake of Irelall(l herself it was desirable that it should not he con­tinued one moment lon~er than was necessary. The lesson of se1f-reliarice and of practical industry is the 0110 of whic h her people most stancf in need, and they cannot too soon begin their apprentice­ship. The theory of relief was not to lead the Irish people on step by step until they could walk alone. A nation is not trained to manly virtue as an infant is taught to walk. A certain ,a,mount of misery and hardship is the Styx in which a pe.:,ple must be plunged, if, like the hero of the pagan fable, they would be invulnerable to hostile attack. Had we persisted in the futile attempt to fodcc­trinate Ireland gradually into self-re­liance, the to-morrow on which she w;ts to be liberated from tutelage would have never come. '.l'he endeavour was made, and it bas been to a wonderful degree a successful one, simply to provide a sfarv­ing people for one year with a substitute for the crop which had rotted amirbt their hands. It was not, however, it,­tended to leave them at the <md of the time preci_sely in the situation in which they were found at the commencement of the relief-for it was fair1y ealc1ilated that the time during which the pe.op1e were supported by the pu1lic bounty wo11ld be occupied by the owners and eccupfore of land in prnparing crops of a less pori1<h­able nature than the one which l1ad le,m swept away by a mysterious cliseasP. We regret much that we have 1Jot foe means of laying before onr roader11 an estimate of the breadth cf land, usually laid out in potatoes, which this year has been sown with wheat, turnips, peas, beans, &c. As for as Ulster is -0oncerned, a correspondent, who :from ha.b~ts and rro­ fe~sit,n v;e belien~ to 11e a competent judge, rnn,is t;S int.elHgence wl,ich will be recein,d with great satiwfaction in this country. The grain crops in that province he describes as the finest he has ever seen ; they .an, now :ripe, tl.nd only waiting for the sickle. The green crops are also of a breadth and style of cultiva­tion that could scarcely have been ex­pected under the pressure of such an emergency, and the whole give evidence of the result of incessant labour. .Altogether, the prospect is most consolatory. 0, si sic omnia I If we could but indulge the hope that the same state of things obtains in the other three provinces of Ireland as in Ulster, we should feel secure that the gloomiest period of Irish history had now become a tale that is told. ' Mr. BULLEN was an eye-witness to the withdrawal of relief in the province of Ulster. As was natnritl, the gloomiest antiqipations seem to have been indulged by the people on the spot as to the effect the measures would have on the minds of the population. There does not, how­ever,_ appear to have been any disturb­ance. The people felt themselves secure in the presence of the harvest, which was first to supply them with employment, and then with food. .Another class might contemplate the prospect before them with equal pleasure ; for, if the enthu­siasm of our correspondent be borne out by the facts, it is not likely, for this year at least, that the New Poor Law will bear very hardly upon the ratepayers of Ulster. It is not, however, only in the province of Ulster, but throughout the whole of Ireland, that the gloomy prophecies of the ruin of the real land­lords are, we believe, destined to meet with a signal contradiction. We do not speak of the nominal. landlords, the men with a nominal £3,000 and a real £300 per annum. We take the rental of Ire­land in the gross, and we believe that it is, in almost every union, quite capable of supporting as large a rate as will, in average times and with average manage­ment, be required, and yet leave the pro­prietary body unscathed by that ruin they have so long affected to apprehend.",MAGNITUDE OF RELIEF OPERATIONS,2,8/25/1847
"THE IRISH CROPS IN 1847. (LETTER TO THE EDITOR, THURSD.A.Y7 .AUGUST 26, 1847.) Sir,-The state of this country at the present moment cannot but pro\ e inter­esting to your numerous readers, and, as I have just returned from an excursion through the province of Ulster, I beg to lay the result of my observations before you. I am happy to inform you that the grain crop is the finest I ever saw, and reeling ripe ; it now only waits for the si.ckle to pour peace and plenty on the land. The green crops are equally fine, and of a breadth and style of cultivation that I never expected to have witnessed in so short a time and at such an emergency. Turnip cultivation is the leading feature of the scene, and nowhere did I ever see such crops of this valuable esculent. In­stead of a -few stunted patches, as for­merly, sown broadcast and never cleaned, the eye now wanders .over vast fields of green luxuriance, without a weed to be seen ; the drills well formed, the ridges clean and 'free from fouiness, and the whole showing the effects of that endless and incessant labour incident to this im­proved syst~m of husbandry. The bean crop also looks uncommonly well, and it is. much to be desired that this most use­ful food should be more generally ex­ tended in this country. Considering the present st.ate and prospects of Ireland, there appears to be 110 crop better adapted to its wants <tnd l'esources than peas and beans, :)r none that I would wish to see more generally cultivated. It is a better food for man than any vegetable, keeps well, is easily prepared and cooked, and every way adapted to the wants and habits of our poor farmers. With regard to the potato crop, it, no doubt, looks well ; and, considering the i.dvanced period and fineness of the season, I am strongly incl.ined to hope . that it is Mfe. It now constitutes what it ought ever to have been-namely, a valu­able ingredient in our rotation system ; ,and I sincerely trust that the experience of the past, a11d sound good . seuse of the future, will ever keep it from again be­coming th.e sole staple food of a civilized people. Sir, the sta.te of things I have just de­ scribed appears to have had a most salu­ tary effect upon the minds and habi.ts of the labouring population in these dis­ tricts. I watched with feverish anxiety the progress of events on Monday last, shariug in the general dread of the sud­ den suspension of the late relief system before the possible adoption of the new, and dreading lest society should burst its bounds from the pressure from within; but, thanks to the bountiful munificence of Providence, the crisis passed off in peace. Th0 prospect of the future was so cheering, and ihJ demand for labour so general .and immediate, that the public mind appeared to have been suddenly ap­peased and subsided into a state of healthy confidence and tranquillity. Everywhere I went I saw the legitimate functions of society restored, and Jab:mr apparently absorbed into its proper chan­nels. The fields wue full of industrious men and women engaged in their le~iti­mate avocations. Some were reaprng, others deeply occupied in the cultivation of their green crops ; and crowds of little children were scattered ovtr the turnip fields, thinning and we?ding them, and lending their infant labour to the general stock. The appearance of the lab:mring population was also gratifying in these favoured districts. They looked clean, contented, and happy, able and willing to do their w01 k, and consoious of a certain return for their exertions-not like the famished-looking phantoms in the south and west, that I saw toiling on the roads in April last, whose unhappy lot it was to have the punishment of the convict and the felon added to their original in­fliction, without the consolation that their exertions would be beneficial either to themselves or the community. Thorough draining has been executed to a considerable extent in certain places. It is not, however, genera.I, owing in a great deeree to the uncertainty that at­tended the arrangements at the close of the session before last. It struck me, also, that many of the localities have not been judiciously selected ; traversing large tracts of mountain wastes whh indiscrimi­nate drains according to plans laid down in a public office is not, in my mind,likely to be either profitable or productive, and will require a vast and immediate com­mand of capital, both in farm-buildings, stock, and labour, to render anything like return for the past expenditure. It is much to be regretted, therefore, that the efforts of the Executive were not more generally directed to draining the low lan<ls, already cultivated, so as to make good land better, and to secure a speedy and a certain return for the outlay. I have ever considered a general system of tile-making as the proper commence­ment of thorough draining inthis country. There is nothing like beginning right, and laying a proper founda.tion ; conse­quently, I have always had my misgivings that importing tiles and pipes from Eng­land and Scotland at great expense, and carting such a bulky material into the central districts, can ever pay. It absorbs a great portion of the capital, aRd deprives the Irish bbourer and artisan of his right -namely, the absorption of his labour and exertions, where pcssible, upon tl;ie spot. I was, therefore, much gratified at see­ing some of the finest clay and manu­factured tiles and pipes from within a""few miles of Londonderry, and was told that there was no limit to the quantity that could be procured for the purpose. 'Ihe superintendent of Mr. Weller's tile-mak­ing machine also told me t.hat he never s:tw finer, or clay that w;,s more easily worked, an<l the articles were superior to any I ever saw in this country. If thif{ be the fact, it is a most important point, and ought to be foUowed up at once. The gentry and large proprietors ought to be called upon forthwith-nay, in fact, coerced, to establish tile-factories on their estates, for the benefit of their tenants and neighbours. When-England became a grain-eating nation, the wisdom ofour ancestors also established manor mills on everv estate for their tenants, and guarded their mutual privileges with the utmost jealousy. And so it is with Ireland at present. We have suddenly J:iecome a. grain-consuming population, and every precaution ought to be made at once for securing these manufactured articles to the public with facility and ease. Sir, I am confident that by the general adoption of a few such tim'31y acts as these, combined with the plentiful supply of food now almost within our reach, the present crisis can be pass£d, and many of our difficulties surmounted. Let ns only learn the value of self-reliance, of mutual co-operation. Let us not be looking to the Government and an over-worked Ex­ecutive at every hand's turn, for assisfr ance and relief. No country was, ever yet made prosperous or wealthy by Acts of Parliament. The power of the Legisla­ture is limited and much misunderstood. It cannot make a people frugal .or indus­trious, the only source of national happi­neBs or wealth. It can remove difficulties-; it may supply certain wants ; but it cat. not and ought not to he caUed upon to supply the functions of a nation, and usurp those duties which civilized man i,J imperatively called upon to discharge himself for his existence. The most formidable difficulty I see to contend with for the future is the total want or almost destruction of stock and cattle throughout the whole pountry. I: appears to me the most alarming feature for the future, for I cannot possibly con ceive how the relations of husbandry can be carried out, or tho new improvements in draining or reclamation can be made productive or available, without an in­creased supply of this essential article. If, therefore, the stock question be not taken up at once and properly inquired into-if the facts be not known and stated,and the most vigorous efforts made to supply the deficiency,the consequences 'will be more disastrous than any we have yet experienced. But, on the whole, Sir, I feel confident from what I have seen, that the darkest hour of any is already past, and that the crisis is over in Ireland. Many great im­pediments to social improvement have been suddenly removed, and a spirit of mutual co-opflration now appears to pre vail which never before existed. Let us, then, enjoy the present calm in reviewing the past, in order to guard against the future. Let our plans be prepared and matured, and, without confideuce or drnpair, be suited to the wants and re­sources of the country. We have many favourable elements atour command, many happy combinations, and I think I may also say, with the unanimous consent of all parties, that we 'now have a respon­sible head to our local Government, every way calculated by age, abilities, and ex­perience to reconcile and direct these various elements, and by their judicious direction to relieve the present wants and develop the future resources of the country.

"LOCAL PLEAS FOR NON-PAYMENT OF LOANS. (LEADING ARTICLE, ""WEDNESDAY, SEP.TEMBER 8, 1847.) The great Irish difficulty, in the course of its Protean transformations, is re­solving itself into something of an ordi­nary character. From almost every union in Ireland we hear that portentous an­nouncement, so familiar to the ears of all who happen to be in the way of giving trust to their neighbours,that they are not able to settle their account. Ont of 130 unions, we believe only eight confess to any money in hand. There is a unive-r­aal demanq for more time, under circum­stances which assure us that delays are dangerous. In many districts it is com­puted that the rates under the New Poor Law will swallow up all that can be pos­ sibly scraped from the people,_ and that -nothing will be left for the liquidation of the late Fainine Loan ; and in not a -Jew particularly ill-favoured districts it is -gloomily pronounced impossible to feed -the-people, even if the rent be altogother 'sacrificed. Although there is doubtless an amazing degree of exaggeration and ;downright invention in these statements, ):et' we cannot doubt they contain a sub­'lltratum of truth. We cannot avoid the 'conclusion that Ireland will find it very difficult to repay even a moiety of what 'we have lent, and that thewhole strength of the country will be taxed for the fear­ful burdens it has now to undergo. Nor can we doubt that there is much honest, unaffected, genuine insolvency. Nor, again, iR there any reason to doubt-but, on the contrary, we are most happy to know, that almost everywhere in the midst of this region of landlordism there exist a few righteous men who do their duty, and just save t1eir class, if not from the judgments of Heaven, at least from the unqualified censures of man. Of course, there are other objects to be considered than the duty of a fair esti­mate. That alone, however, is em­barrassing enough. Where is the man who has discharged his conscience on the subject of Ireland, a11d has not seen reason to revise and amend his judgment before another month has expired? Every side of the question presents itself i.n turn with a force absolutely overpowering. ""An Irish Pauper,"" who dates his letter from that Ireland of Irelands, M'Gilli­cuddy's Reeks, County of Korry,gives us that view which certainly possesses pre­pondera.ting attractions with the people of England, viz., which lays most on the shoulders of the landlord. Read the letter, and how true and familiar it sounds ! How clear it seems to ring I We are not speaking of what it proposes, but what it tells and dornribcs. It is impossible to doubt a relator who speaks with such simp1ici.ty ;ind force, and whose statements unfortunately tally with all we know or are likely to know. But RUB­pend your judgment. Andi ciltera1n partcm. The landlord or some one who has found a good stratum of landlords undr-:rtakes their defence. He describes them as poor struggling men, rari nantes in gnr­gite vasto, who_ in the midst of difficulties sufficient to break tho highest spirit, to craze the hardest head, drain the fullest purse, and cross the finest temper, have nevertheless kept on,andare still proudly breasting tho waves of social misery and strife. We may grant that this is true also. Surely there must be some good landlords in Ireland, else what would long since have become of the class? There is; unquestionably, the greatest possible difference between districts and men. Nowher0 has this fact been brought out with more circumstance and force than in these columns. 'J.'he Times is the only British authority which has ,ventured to embrace the whole surface of Ireland in one review, having, at the _same time, the temerity t:> discriminate and show the good and the bad in their proper relief. If at. any time we have seemed to relapse into vague generalities, it is only because Ireland certainly does present itself in one simple character with some pervading attributes. Ireland demands Repeal. Ireland begs. Ireland is excused direct taxes. Ireland lives on potatoes. The potato fails, and Ire­land . suffers famine ; Ireland comes on the :i'reasury for assistance. Ten millions are borrowed at great loss by an embar­rassed people and advanced to Ireland. Half. df it is given to Ireland. The chief spokesmen of-Ireland threaten that the :five millions not given, but only lent, will not be repaid, or, if repaid at all, will be so very slowly indeed. It is natural to personify an agent which acts and speaks with so energetic a uniformity. We talk, therefore, of Ireland, Irish landlords, and Irish peasants, not as doubting there are some exceptions to the rule, but merely taking the facts in that almost unvaried simplicity in which they are actually presented to our senses. What renders it still more difficult for the English to dis~riminate between the sheep and the goats of the Irish flock is that every post brings over a b.idget of news, consisting of little else than im­pudent repudiations of debt and savage abuse of the British benefactor. Ireland -we really cannot help sprnking of her oollectively-after sucking tbe very blood of Englund for these many months, returns much the same thanks to the people who ha""e suffered, and are suffer­ing, for her sake, that a wolf would return to the man who should be simple enough to draw it out of a pit. There is hardly a British operatii-e who is not pinched in his wages, there is hardly a British tradesman who is not pinched in his business, by the unparalleled sacrifice we have made t0 give er lend what we could to our Irish fellow-subjects. Yet here is the mail xgain, as the last mail, and most.probably the next, bringing over brutal invectives and insolent disclaimera of obligation. There may be much of a contrary character in Ireland, but why doPs it not contrive to make itself audible and also influential? We are justified in susrecting an interrnted silence. If Tralee should l,-arry its point by effrontery it ,yould be so much in the pockets of all the landlords of Ireland. They would rather, of course, that others did so dirty a job. But so long as they let others be the spokesmen of Ireland they must be content to take a share in tho scandal. Should thnse spokesmen succeed, ,10 are sure th11re is not a landlord in Ireland who will refuse his full share in the profit. It is for the Irish themselves to esta­blish any distinctions they may wish to feel. There are repudiatin~ and non­repudiating States in America. Let the non-repudiating unions of Ireland hasten to disavow their share in this baseness. Let the landlords come forward. The guardians of Tralee are fighting the battle of the landlord. In this question the Board of Guardians wholly consist of landlords and their squires. It is the interest of them all to make the spinners of Manohester, the weavers and stock­ingers of Nottingham, and the labourers of Dorsetshire, maintain the Irish poor. Whatever can be filched from the Im­ perial Treasury will find its way into the pocket of the Irish proprietor. Mr. J. O'CONNELL himself ls doing landl9rds' work when he shows such anxiety to thrust out the paupers of his country upon the shores of this island. It is for the Irish proprietor9 themselves to cle'ar their own characters. Their tenants, the priests and the demagogues of their country, are involving them in the sins of dishonesty and ingratitude. Is it with their own free will and consent ? If it is, their silence is intelli~ible. If it is not, let them speak out betimes.",LOCAL PLEAS FOR NON-PAYMENT OF LOANS,2,9/8/1847
"HORRORS OF THE EXODUS TO CANADA. (LEADING ARTICLE, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1847.) The great Irish famine and pes­tilence will have a place in that melancholy series of similar calami­ties to which historians and poet.s have. contributed so many harrowing details and touching expressions. Did Ireland possess a writer endued with the laborious truth of THUCYDIDES, the grace­ful fe1icity of VIRGIL, or the happy in­vention .of DE ]'oE, the events of this miserable year might be quoted by the scholars for ages to come together with the sufferings of the pent-up multitudes of Athens, the distempered plains of northern Italy, or the hideous ravages of our own great plague. But Time is ev""r improving on the past. Tl:!ere is one horrible feature of the recent, not to say the present, visitation which is entirely new.Sllie fact of more .than a hundred thousand souls flying from the v~ry midst of the calamity acro,s a great .ocean to a new world, ,Q_rowdiIJg__: int() _ir,sufficie!!t VJlllS01S, l,Cl'(l,IUbling .Jor a footing on a deck and a bertn in a hold, o::,mmitting tlfomscives to these worse than prisons, while their frames were wasted with ill­;fare and their blood infected with disease, fighting for months of unutterable wretchedness against lhedements without and pestilence within, giving almost hourly victims to the deep, landing at length on shores already terrified and diseased, consigned to encampments of the dying and of the dead, spreading death wherever 'they roam, and having no other prospect before them than a long continuance of these horrors in a still farther :flight across fornsts and lakes under a Canadian sun. and a Canadian frost,--,--all these are circumstances beyond the experience of the Greek historian or the Latin poet, and such as an Irish nestilence alone could produce.' -By the end of the season there is little doubt that too immigration into Canada alone will have amounted to 100,000 ; nearly all from Ireland. We know the condition in which these poor ci-eatu,es embarked on their perilous adventure. They were only tlying from one form of death. On the authority of the. Montreal Bofl.rd,of Health we are enabled to state that . they were allowed to. ship in numbers two or three times gretLter..than the same vessels would have presumed to carry to a United States port. The wors1 horrors of that slave trade which it is the boast or the ambition of this empire to suppress, at any cost, have been re­enacted in the flight of British subjects from their native shores. In only ten of the vessels that arrived at Montreal in July, four from Cork and six from Liver­pool, out of 4,427 passengers, 804 h11,d died on the passage, and 847 were sick on their arrival ; that is, 847 were visibly diseased, for the result proves that a far larger number had in them the seeds of disease. The Larcl1,"" says the Board of Health on August 12, "" re­ported this morning from Sligo, sailtid with 440 passengers, of whom 108 died on the passage, and 150 w,ire sick. The Virginius sailed with 496-158 died on the passage, 186 were sick, and the remainder landed feeble and tottering-' the captain, mates, and crew were all sick. The Black Hole of Calcutta was a mercy compared to the bolds of these vessels. Yet simultaneously, as if in, reproof of those on whom the blame of _all this . wretchedness must fall, foreigners, Germans from Hamburg and Bremen, are daily arriving, all healthy, robust, and cheerful."" This vast unmanageable tide of population thus thrownupon Montreal, like the fugitives from some bloody _defeat, or devastated country, has. been greatly augmented by the prudent, and, we must add, most necessary, precautions. adopted in time by the United States, where more stringent sanitary re,gula­tions, enforced by severer penalties, hav.e been adopted to save the ports of the Union from those very horrors which a paternal Government has suffered to fall upon Montreal. Many of these pest ships have been obliged to alter their destination, even while at-sea, for the St. Lawrence. At Montrel\l a large pro­portion of these outu:;ists have lingered .from sheer inability to proceed. i'he inh ,bitarits of course have been infected. I<°'rom the official returns of burials at Montreal, for the nine weeks ending August 7, itappears that in the city ther.e ,died during that p.eriod.924,residents and 806 emigrants, making a total of 1,730 _deaths. Bes-ides thes(l l,510 emigran~ died at the sheds, making a grand total of 3,240 in the crty of Montreal and ite fill t~'l!/lPPn Ll!,Zaretto ; against only 488, including residents and emigrants, for the corresponding weeks last year. A still more horrible silauel is to come. The survivors have to""wander forth and :find homes. Who can say how many will perish on the way, or the masses of house­less,,famish€d, and half-naked wretches that will be strewed on the inhospitable snow when a Canadian winter once sets in. Of the~e awful occurrences some account must be given. Historians and politicians ,vill some day sift. and weigh the conflicting narrations and documents of this lamel)table year, and pronounce, with or without affection, how much is due to the inclemency of Heaven, and how much to the cruelty, heartlessness, or improvidence of man. The boasted insti­ tutions and spirit of this empire are on trial. They are weighed in the balance. ];amine and pestilence are at the gates, and a conscience-stricken nation might almcei. fear to see the'' writing on the wall."" We are forced to confe9s that whether it be the fault of our laws or our men, this new act in the terrible drama has not been met a,s humanity and common'sEnse would enjoin. The result was.,quite within the sc_Qpe of calculation ,and ev.en of cure. r-For our own part, 'bef.ore <>ne emigrant ves8el had left our ports, and when thoughtless and selfish men were first beginning tn talk of a great systematic plan of emigration, we calkd the attention of the Legislature to the dreadful scenes that would be wit­nessed on board the emigrant fleet, crowded with wretclies already at death's door, predisposed to almost any malady, and certain vict:ma to the first existing cause of disease. We subsequently ex­posed the wickedness of .transporting our pauperism to shores where no provision was made for its reception, and to a climate wh.;re all the necessaries of life were at least as indispensable as m our own. The simple ,and infallible character of the precautions proper for the safe trans­port of such a multitude will be seen from the letter written at our suggestion by the late lamented Dr. COMBE, and un­fortunately interi:upte<l by his death. By the kindness of a friend our readers are permitted to hear '.' his voice from the grave,"" aud it will, we trust, be heard where snch warnings are certainly needQd. But simple as precaution was, what has ceen done 1 In the first place, our usual regulations as to the propor::­tions of passengers to tonnage ru:e lax enough. Then, it appears that British ves.,els bound to Canada, owing to the recent t epeal of a former ~nactment, need nvt, and do net, take out s:nrgeons. Then, as a correspondent informs us, the in­srectors appointed to see that emigrant 1<hips chartered from British ports ob­served such regulations as there are, have gener;illy failed in their duty. Into this part of the busine~s we hope that Parlia­ment will not omit to inquire. Fur­ther, notwithstanding the assumnces given to the Legislature last sernion, it is quite clear that due prepara­tion has not-beo1i made at the colony. As the Montreal Board of Health justly complains, there. have been no .adequate fundB, or even compe ent authority, pro­vided for the crisis ; the establishment at Grosse Isle bas l:eeu ridiculously in­sufhuient, nor have any measures what­ever been. adopted or thought of for tr.e transmission of the helpless and destitute crowd beyond Montreal, much less for tlieir employment and settleme.nt. Such nrglect is an eternal scandal to the British name ; nor do we see any way to rncape the opprobrium of, a national in­humanity, except by taking the earliest and !Dost effectual means to rectify -past errors, and prevent their recurrence.",HORRORS OF THE EXODUS TO CANADA,2,9/17/1847
"RESISTANCE TO POOR’S-RATES. (LEADING ARTICLE, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1847.) We shall not trouble ourselves with any apology for insi8ting that the :first duty of Ireland at the present juncture is to pay all that it owes, both for the or dinary and extraordinary relief of its poor. It is only called upon to pay five 'millions ou~-of the ten millions advanced for the temporary measures. There can be no hardship ther.i, considering that Great Britatn was all the. tim11 maintain ing its own poor, and was suffering great scarcity and Jommercial depression. Five millimfs are only a third part of the esti­mated rental of the Irish soil, and far below the sum commonly supposed to find its way annually into the pockets of absentees. As for the ordinary poor's­rate, now, of cours3, considerably enlarged by the institution of out-door relief, it remains to be seen what that will amount to. Many estimates are afloat which appear to be exaggerated, but which are, at all events, nothing but estimates, and that by interested authorities. The Po3r Law hitherto in Ireland has J,een a mere farce, and it is likely enough that they who have hitherto been paying only a few pence in the p:mnd for the r\llief of the poor should raise an alarm at tho prospsct of having to pay perhaps as many shillin;;s. It is unnecessary, therefore, to participate in their alarm till the rates h,i,ve been actually collected, the poor re­lieved, the annual amount ascertained. Should it then be found that the landlord is left as much in the lurch as many an Enizliah landlord has been, and is at this moment, it will be for us to turn our attention to his sufferings. Meanwhile the charity which the ImpP-rial Legisla­tu:i:e has thrust ou the Irish proprietor is fl,n immense boon to Ireland, which the illople -of that unfortunate country, if they have a gleam of common sense, will r.ender effectual by every mean11 in their power. _ . The principles of common humanity introduced in the Irish Poor Law constitute tho greatest triumph yet achieved over the monster evil of Ireland -its absenteeism. An effective Poor Law is the only conceivable method of laying an embargo on the absentee rents. But for our own English laws, the greater part of this island would have presented the samo miserable spectacle of horrid, un­heeded, unrelieved_poverty. Rents would have flowed from the provinces to the metropolis, to the watering places, or the co11tinent, in one continual stream, without leaving. an odd Eixpence in the pound for the destitute poor, who would have rotted as they have done till now in Galwayor Cork. Now,with ""a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together,"" we have squeezed a little d2cency out of the proprietor. We have rendered the poor the first mortgagee. He comes first, then the money lender, then the landlord. In fact, we have given the poor man a rent. That r2nt is now to be oollE>cted. Will the millions of Ireland be so infatuated as to aid the makmtents in withholding it ? If the rates are not collected, of course the poor will soon be dying by the road­3j,fos. laid on too suy,face of churchyards. and gnawed by dogs aq before, with nO other relief in prospect for the survivors than a daily journey to some distant relief works for 8d. a day. Let them look to it in time that they do not, by their mere habit of resistance to pecuniary demands, afford any couoteuance to the idea that rates cannot b:i collected. Others will be the gainers by their folly. Should they see the wealthier farmers combining to resist the payment of rates, and here and there a landlord laughing at the sport, let them remember that thems3lves are the victims, One rule for Englan<l and for Ireland, In thi3 cJtrntry the poor's-rate r.as always had precedence of rent. First the poor, then the landlord. In the whole of our social economy, there has been nothing so invariable, so indispensable, so unin­terrupted as the !1ayment of rates. The landlord, indeed, may have his mis­givings as Michaelmas draws nigh, and will prudently abstain from "" counting his chickens before they are hatched ;"" the steward may make up his mind for two or three defaulters ; the relation of the tenant farmer to the lord of the £oil forms no exception to the proverbial nn­certaiuty of human siffairs. It is not-so with the rate for the 11oor. It must be collected, and it is collected. The dapper little collector takes the parish by house row, armed with a rate-book and portable writing apparatus that lay open <loors, po<:Jkets, and pur ses, more effec­tually than a battering-ram or a park of ariillery. Here and there some one modestly requests a little grace, which is granted, because ib will not be abused, But whether the amount be small or great, it is always paid. Old woruen, orphans, and cripples, the lame and the blind, the very outcasts of society, have the first-fruits of the harvest. The land­lord takes his turn after them, and gleans what he can. Good years or bad years, high prices or low pricE's, it is all the same with the in,door or the out-door pauper. There is no abatement of the weekly bill of fare, the loaf or the pay. The landlord takes the whole of the risk. If there must be a reduction somewhere, he is sacrificed. He puts down his hors_es, and gives up his intended new carriage ; he turns economist in his kitchen or hls ga~den ; or he po 0 tpones to another year sending "" HARRY "" to Eton. Thus does he stand the brunt of thfl storm which passeg over the head of the pauper. We are only asking the same rule for Ireland. Rnt.h the oi vil and the ecclesiastical chiefs of the, Irish democracy appear to understand the value of the poor's-rate and the motives of those who resist it. Mr. J. O'CONNELL treats the question with a spice of his father's vigour, though he also betrays the same error of feeling and of policy which prevented his father from recognizing British sympathy, from whatever quarter it proceeded, and so far prevented a cordial co,operation of British and Irish patriotuim. However little he may be disposed to believe it, a pure unmixed pity for the condition of tbe Irish peasant, and an honest indigna­tion at the selfish position assumed by the proprietor, were tbe mainsprings of that move:nent which has thrust a better Irish Poor Law on the Legislature. There are friends of Ireland here who have wished it long,enough, but l1ave not been heeded untilNature h.:rself added a fearful significance to their coun~els. The fact is as Mr. J. O'Co:rrnELL states. If the people of Ireland only fee that the poor­rates are collected, they are scathless. Every acre is pledged to their support. Ejectments will no longer rid the land­owner of his burdens. He has his choice of a tenant or _a pauper. Let him take which he pleases. He will find it better to receive a little than to pay, a good deal. The parish priests are openi11g tte eyes of their people to the ne.v hold they posse,ss on the soil of their country, and the interests if nut the affections of their landlords. There was great opposition at Dingle, whereupon the priest stated. the case very simply from the altar :­"" Heretofore landlords have had agents who collected their rents, and they sup­ported them. The grand jury had agents to collect the county cess, and they sup­ported them. Now, for the first time,the poor man has an agent to collect his rent. That agent is the poor-rate collector, and he should be supported by the poor."" And yet there are persons who fondly. imagine that an anti-rate wa.r can be got up as easily as an anti-tithe war ; and that as Government paid the tithe, it may also pay the rate. There is all the difference in the world between the two cases. The tithes were the property of a small, powerless, and, unfortunately,' not very popular class. The rate is th@ property of the people themselves.",RESISTANCE TO POOR’S-RATES,2,9/21/1847
"FJGHTING PROPENSITIE_S. (LEADING ARTICLE, TUESDAY, SEFTEMBER ~8, 1847.) n is now some years since trial by wager was formally abolished in England. A young woman had been murdered with the greatest atrocity. The murderer was brought to his trial, and nobody doubted the issue. A clever fellow of an attorney, however, had rummaged up an obsolete statute, and when the accused was called upon to plead he demanded another sort of trial-viz., a personal combat with the nearest relative of the deceased, who happened to be the poor girl's brother, a puny and sickly young man. There was no alternative but to admit the plea, and the ruffian escaped. The statute was imme­diately annulled. Now,we are almost dis­posed to ask whether this wasnot done in a hurry. Legislation ought not to be much in advance of the times. It is open to a question whether trial by wager, il}sfaiad of being a step backwards, would not be a positive improvement upon the existing practice of Ireland. In that country there is a sort of natural foundation for the appeal. , There is, in fact, a standing appeal to arms. and undoubtedlv arms do often decide the controversy. The question, therefore, is whether what is now done illegally, roughly, and foully should not be done with fairness and, solemnity. In trial by wager there are spectators, umpires, rules, and invocation of Heaven. That, of course, is an improvement on murder, and on the' numerous gradaticns of menace and inso-, Jenee which derive their only force from the circumstance that they point more or less closely to the possible commission of that crime. Last Wednesday night, in the county of Liµierick, a man was eating his supper by the fire with a child in his arms. An armed party came round his cottage, fired in at the windows and door, shot the man dead, breaking the child's legs, and fled over the bog. Of course it was a, quarrel,about land. If the man had been allowed to exchange a shot with the prin­cipal murderer., he would at least have, had a chance of his life ; and perhaps this, would have satisfied all the instincts ol Milesian equity. Possibly, too. the: '' armed party,"" though they rather liked tb,e fun of discharging all their pieces into a family circle gathered round a turf fire, would liave been glad to sneak out of a combat face to face, and one at a time. The Nenagh Guardian gives us another example to the point, cccurring near Newport. There was a quarrel abcut some cattle and their keep. The owners of the cattle were driving them away,w:hen the servants of the man who had undertaken to keep them interfered to get back the quadruped lodgers. The servants were armed by their employer, and of course used their weapons. One of the two brothers that were driving nay the cattle received a ball in his back, and will probably die. Elsewhere an,agent of Lcrd SHANNON, with a large party, were executing an habere, and taking poss, ssion of a house as lest they o.ould. One of them was ordered to get on the house and strip the roof. The first slate he removed he fell dead to the ground by a shot from .the cccupant, There is all the difference in the world between the last two cases. -In the latter there had been considerable violence t0 the feelings of the manslayer, and ho was one against many. He fought against odds, and faced his danger. It is clear, however,that a trial by wager would have settled both affairs much less.disagree­ably. There would haye been a bit of romance, too, about. them, instead of that ugly gallows look which, with our prudish i<l,,as of equity and law, they must unavoidably wear. But we are forgetting a case vastly Jnore. to the purpose than any we have mentioned. The people in the Lowthers­town union last winter were, or pre­tended to be, in much the same case as the rest of Ireland. They had their wheat .and their barley, but lost their potatoes. Bo the Legislature offered them various kinds of assistance, which were all thank­fully accepted. . One of these kinds was an advance under the "" Temporary Relief Act ""-a sort of provisional Poor Law, to be applied till the permanent measure -could come into operation. When it was passed a declaration had been recently m:ide that half the enor­mous expenses incurred by the "" relief works "" would be undertaken by Govern­ment,. and time aliowed for the repay­ment of the rest. An estimate also was made that of an aggregate ten millions advanced to Ireland, half should be given, half lent. Large sums were given out­righp, and as a set-off against them, as well as for obvious reasons of justice, it was decided and enacted that Irish pro­perty should refund as soon as possible the whole of what was advanced in the particular form of"" temporary relief of rlestitute persons."" There could be no ,piistake about it. Any child who can read the act of 10 VICTORIA, cap. 31, .will see that it has not one word about either giving half the money advanced or post­poning repayment. On the contrary, the Act proceeds some time without saying a word of advances, and only au!horizes them in the case of ready money being wanted, when they may be made on the security of rates. What rates 'I The rates of the next six years ? No ; on the security of rates "" made or about to be made,"" or, as the margin ex)!lresses it, in. "" course of making and collecting."" The guardians of Lowtherstown union, not having money in hand, borrowed underthe Act. It is now their duty to make pro­vision for the repayment of the whole in their next rate. ~hey decline to do so ; and instead thereof modestly propose to wipe out half with the sponge, and pay the rest by six yearly instalments. Nothing could be cookr than such a proposal, excepting, perhaps, the manner in which it is enforced. The Irish Poor Law Commissiohers, on being informed of this resolution, find themselves obliged to put in force an enactment which orders them to suspend the refractory Boards of Guardians, and appoint paid officers to collect rates, and repay the advanc€s. In doing this, how­ever, they write to the defaulters, and point out their dishonesty in borrowing money on certain conditions, and the moment the money is got and spent throwing the conditions to the winds. One point also they bring out which it is particularly important to notice, as we are sure it will tend to counteract a rathe!.' extravagant impression which pre­vails as to the utter poverty of Ireland, and the overwhelming burden of this year's levies. They remind the guardians that the amount of the rate required to repay the whole advance does not exceed ls. 10d. in the pound in any electoral division of the Union, andin one division is as low as 9d. in the pound ; while, if the guardians' own estimate of 10d. in the pound for ordinary expenses is correct, they would not have to make a higher rate than 2s. Sd. in the pound for all purposes in any electoral division ; in one division, inc.lead, not more than ls. 7d. in the pound. Now, we in Eng­ land do not think that so out of reason for a very bad year. Nay, we have many parishes which pay every year, famine or no famine, at least twice as much. On receiving the letter announcing their dismissal and containing these fruitless appeals to their sense of honesty, the guardians immediately answered the Commissioners with-a challenge. As there are twenty guardians and only three Commissioners, we do not know how the affo,ir is to be arranged on the usual plan ; and, therefore, we are inclined to suspect that the guardians have in their eye rather the case of the "" armed party "" who poured a broadside into one man with a child in his arms at Knocksentry than a ,iuiet little exchange of bullets at twelve paces. However that may be, there can be no doubt whatever as to the particular and only possible purport of the intimati,.m. For merely suggesting to the guardians that when mom,y is borrowed under certain conditions of re­payment it is proper that those condi­tions should be observed, the offended guardians tell the Commissioners that in doing so they have taken advan­tage of their official position to use language to a public board which in a private capacity they dare not use to them as private individuals. This, of course, is meant to smell of powder, and to brand with the stigma of cowardice those who do not take it in the sense of the writers. Lest, too, we suppose, the affair should drop through the want of individuality about it, and the multitude of the challenging party, one peppery fellow-a ¥r. W. D'ARCY-particularly given, we­ml1st conclude, to repudiation and pistols, subscribes his name with a protest against the inadequate tone of the letter. Nor is this all. While "" the satisfaction due to a gentleman "" is demanded from the Commissioners, a still more bk>ody threat is held out to the Lords of HER MAJESTY'S Treasury. A sort of Rockite notice is indited and posted to Downing­street, announcing, on the authority of those who are possibly able to fulfil their own gloomy predictions, that if an attempt is madetolevy the rate, a system of resistance will be originated which at future periods it will be difficult to sup­ press. :;:,.Trial by wager is the only sort of jus­tice we see that will satisfy these gentle­men. To be sure, a duel between a debtor and a creditor is not quite fair, as in either case the creditor comes indiffer­ently off. If he kills his man, he kills the debt with him, and he does not get paid by being shot himsalf. We should not be surprised, therefore, to hear that the Lords of the Treasury and the Com­missioners of the Poor Laws decline standing fire. They who handle the pen may justly plead that they are not adepts­at the pistol ; and men who can strike a quarter's balance with wonderful exactness are seldom competent to snuff a cap.dle at twelve paces. In fact, hair triggers are not a part of the public ser­vice. But could not a corps of champions be organized 1 Places are wanted for the promising scions of the aristocracy. There should be more patronage at the Minister's disposal than our grind~ng economy has left us. Instead of makmg young honourables precis writers and <;1,ttaches, let them be trained for Irish field service. In that case when a board of Irish proprietors borrow money and attempt to bluster out of the reckoningby telling HER M.A:;rESTY's public servants that they are not gentlemen, we shall have a body of champions .whom we can better afford to risk, and who, living or dying,' will do honour to their country. A single duel or a tournament will then settle the question of payment; and, even if the country loses the money, there will be at least no more trouble about it.",FJGHTING PROPENSITIE_S,2,9/28/1847

We are sorry to say that the Catholfo clergy has lost another of its members this afternoon, the Rev. Mr. Bardy, vica, at Rimouski, who died at the Hotel Dieu Nunnery, of fever contracte.d at Grosse Isle. (From the Montreal Herald, Sept. 4.) On Wednesday last his Excellency the Governor-General visited the new emi­grant hospitals on Point St. Charles, and, after a minute inspection of allthe various departments, we are happy to learn, ex­pressed his entire sa.tisfaction with the complete and admirable arrangements of the whQle establishment. We visited theshedsyesterdaymorning, and propose briefly to state wha.t we saw. The emigrants are landed at a temporary wharf, above the terminus of the Lachine Canal. They are carried clear past the city, and sent up ina barge, as they arrive, to Windmill-point. Thence the he!!Jlthy are forwarded as fast as possible to Lachine, on their journey westward. A continuous barrier, between the landing­place and the canal, is erected, and on the canal itself the bridge is carefully guarded ,by police, who prevent any unnecessary .communication with the city, passes being given to those who really have business, with the hours specified both for departure and return. A road by the river con­ducts to the old emigrant sheds, which 11,re also completely fenced in and used only for the temporary reception of the healthy. Of this large pile of buildings .one is appropriated to the children of emi­'grants lying sick at the hospital. About :120 are there at this moment, who are lwell fed and attended to, and taught to read and write, so far as practicable. If their parents survive, they are forwarded 'with them ; if left orphans, they are con­signed to different charitable institutions. So far there is neither cause,nor can there be any reasonable apprehension, of in­ fe3tion. (From the Montreal Pifot, Sept. 11.) We are happy to say that the mortality at the emigrant sheds is abated, still the diminution is nearly as much attributable to want of material on which to work as to a general improvement of health. The in­mates of the hospitals are nowa little over i,000 ; the daily rate of mortality varies from 12 to 24. Would we could congratu­l~te the country that proper measures had been taken to provide for the misery and destitution which, superadded to the ravages of disease, are to be apprehended in the ensuing winter ! But we hear of no such timely provision, and what is to be the fate of our unforttmate country­men who have betaken themselves to our land to relieve themselves from the miseries entailed on them by injustice and oppression at home, God only knows ! Surely, on our executive a serious re­sponsibility rests; and, if they have not in a voice of thunder demanded from the British Government the means of support of those poor creatureswhohave been thus unfeelingly cast forth unprovided to "" bide the pelting of the pitiless storm,"" they have committed a crime to which their former misdeeds are as ""dust in the balance."" We do hope that this neglect of a sacred duty is not to be added to the black catalogue of their offences. (From the Montreal Courier, l:lept. 6.) We have received this month's number of the British AmerieanJonrn.alo.f Science, from which we extract thefollowing para­graphs. We are happy to see that there is a decrease in the mortality in this city:­ "" Judged by the mortality reports and general professional experience,the health of the city is improving, although the ratio of deaths from fever is still inordi­nately high. For the last t,m weeks the weekly returns of mortality from that cause alone are as follows :­ "" June 19th, 3 ; 26th, 4. "" July 3d, 12 ; 10th, 56 ; 17th, 53 ; 24th, 60 ; 31st, 68. ' "" August 7th, 37 ; 14th, 40 ; 21st, 36 ; 28th, 31. "" Other prevailing diseases are dysen­tery and di<lrrhcea, the former of which is more than usually prevalent this sea­son. From all accounts the sanitarv state of Quebec has not improved much ; typhus fever, introduced by the. immi­grants,being remarkably prevalent ; while at Grosse Isle, though matters seemed to be improving, the mortality among the immigrants is still immense. On Sunday, the 22d, at 10 a.m., there were 2,048 patients in hosiptal,.1 and the deaths for the week ending the same day at noon were 228. At the emigrant hospital, Point St. Charles, on the 30th of August, there were 1,198 sick ; and 20 deaths took place during the preceding 24 hours. Now, however, that the temperature of the air has become cooler, we may 1mtici­pate a more healthy condition of both the cities."" (From the Toronto Patriot.) The following is the presentment by the Grand Jury at the last Mayor's Court. It deserves a careful perusal :­ ,' City of Toronto, Home District, to wit-The jurors of our Sovereign Lady the Queen, on their oaths present, that in obedience to the charge delivered by the Court at its opaning, they have conferred together on the subject of the large pauper emigra.tion from the mother country to the province this season ; the amount of sicknes~ and mortality among the emigrants ; the extreme helpless­ness of the large majority of them, and the abrming prospect before them on the near approach of winter, from the want of means for their support, the want of em­ployment by which to maintain them­selves and families, and their general inability to labour, on account of their want of a knowledge of the commonest arts and occupations of life, even if em­ployment were provided for them. In all parts of the province to which portions of the emigrants have been dispersed severe sickness bas accompanied them to an alarming extent ; ho1<pitals have had to be erected for their special accommo­dation, Boards of Health established, and large expenditures incurred for their hos­pital attendance and medical treatment and support, beyond the ordinary dis­bursements for passage and rations while proceeding to their several destinations, and the cost of erecting or renting houses for hospitals. These expenses the Grand Jury are given to understand are borne by the Home Government, and defrayed under the immediate direction of the Boards of Health at the different stations. But there is no provision made for the support or employment of the patients on being discharged from the hospitals. '.!.'hey are allowed to roam at large, either to beg or starve, and instances frequently occur of their relapsing after being discharged, and returning from the country to the city to resume their places in the hos­pital. In Toronto some of qur humane citizens have formed a society for the re­liefof the widows and orphan, of deceased emigrants, but the means at their dis­posal are very limited, being derived en­tirely from the voluntary contributions of the benevolent. It must be obvious that this laudable effort will fall infinitely short of what is required to meet the try­ing emergency. It is very evident that during the winter the cities and towns of the province will be inundated by thousands of these unfortunate people, unless timely provision is made for their employment and support in some way or other. To allow them to become a bn:­den on the public charity would be mc>st unjust towards the industrious inhabi­tants ; nor can it be expected that they would quietly submit to such an imposi­tion any more than the inhabitants of the cities and towns in Great Britain, for whose relief special provision has, we un­derstand, been made by Parliament, in the authority recently granted for sending the pauper emigrants back to their parishes in Irllland, there to be provided for by those upon whom the burden of their support ought legitimate1y to fall. In the United States the iiiflux of pauper emigrants is effectually prevented by the laws of that country, so that the whole of them intended for this continent find their way into the BritishNorth American Pro vinces, and chiefly to Canada. Jndeed, cases have occurred of emigrant ships having been refused landing at the port of the United fltates, on account of the poverty and sickness of the passengers, and they were therefore driven for shelter into ""the British American ports, where the poor emigrants who survived were landed. Nearly 30,000 souls bave already pa-ssed the port of Toronto this year ; and there ar~ at present upwards of 1,100 patients in the Toronto hospitals, besides the widows and orphans in the asylum humanely provided for them, numbering about 200. The fund as yet collected for the support of this asylum falls consider­ably short of £200, far too small a sum for the purpose, and it is by no means pro bable that a sufficient amount will be!raised by voluntary effort to carry the es­ :tablishment through the winter, with the great increase of inmates that may be ex­pected to flock to it. Severe sickness and death have ;been of frequent occurrence among the attendants at the hospitals, c.aused by the unceasing labours imposed on them, among the hµndreds of fever patients with whom they are continually intermingling. Sickness also prevails ex­tensively throughout the province,caused, in many instances, as we are informed, by contagion from diseased emigrants, iind too frequeutly terminating fatally. ""The Grand Jury, deploring these cir­ cumstances, feel constrained to call tl:e attention of the Court to them, and by this means 'they trust also the attention of the proper authorities, 'SO that timely relief may he provided against the a'{l­ palling calamities with which we are threatened on the approach of winter. ,I 2 They cannot countenance a proposal to tax the inhabitants of the city for this pur­pose. Already the amount of taxation imposed for civic purposes (besides the school tax) is as large as the corporation would venture to inflict, or the inhabi­tants can well bear. The powers of the corporation go no further than ls. 6d. in the pound for ordinary taxation, and the rate now imposed is ls. 1-l.d. in the pound (exclusive o_f the school tax), leaving but 4½<l. in the pound to reach the utmost limit. The grcss annual revenue arising born the pre­sent rate is about £6,000, independent of the school funds ; and were an ad­ditional rate of 4½d. laid on (being to the full extent of the powers of the corparation), the amount to be realized from it would most likely fall far short of what would be rtiquired for the support of the great number of pauper emigrants who would be induced to flock hither from the knowledge of such a provision being made for theni,while the imposition of such a tax, for such a purpose, would manifestly be as unjust as it would be bur­densome and intolerable to the inhabi­tants of the city. , Neither can the Grand Jury see upon what principle of justice the support of these pauper emigrants can bti made a charge upon the revenues of the province. They are not aware of any grounds that can be urged for burdening Canada with the support of the poor of the British Isles, who ought to have been maintained i11 their own parishes at home, or, ifsent from home, who ought to have been sent with proper provisions, so as not to prove a laad and a bmden to those among whom they have come, and a shame and disgrace to those by whom they were sent, or who permitted them to leave their own shores in such a state of helpless wretchedness. The visitation is one of extreme hardship, both to the unfortunate emigra1Jts and to _the province ; and the Grand Jury feel that they would ill discharge their duty did they abstain from freely expressing their sentiments regarding it. "" It becomes a very delicate point to eoggest any course to be pursued under such trying circumstances ; but the Grand Jury, in obedience to the invitation of the Court, would respectfully submit, that the necessary funds for the emergency ought legitimately to be supplied by the Home Government. .And they would further respectfully suggest, that the mayors and presidents of police in cities and towns, and the wardens of districts, might with propriety be placed in funds by Government, for the employment and support of indigent emigrants, at the dis­cretion of the Government ; that the pro­duct of the labour of the emigrants would be accounted for, at its fair value, to the Government, and the funds to be set apart relieved to that amount. The able­bodied would be obliged to work or want, where work was offered to them, and the frail and disabled only be permitted to subsist exclusively on the Government bounty. ""'£he Grand Jury would also respect­fully state to the Court the . gratification it affords them to bear ttistimony to' the activity and euer!P' of the Toronto Board of Health, and the very efficient manner in which the arduous duties devolving upon them have been discharged. "" Thf) Grand Jury present herewith a report from the gaoler on the state of the gaol, and beg to call the particular atten­tion of the Court and the proper autho­rities to the facts therein disclosed, and which the Grand Jury are aware have been repeatedly brought under consideration by many previous grand juries.

"(LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1847,) The boast of .Britain is her transmarine beneficence, an almost unlimited sway. empire. The sun never sets on her do­The number and variety of nations, of minion, In every continent and in either colours, of climes, of religions, and of hemisphere she exercises . with compara­laws, united into one vast whole under tive peacefulness, and with acknowledged our QUEEN, reduce to an empty ostenta-. iion the antique or barbarous titles of Emperor and Czar. To rule the waves, indeed, would be an idle ambition, were it 11ot that wherever those waves beat the shore, whether in the Australasian archi­pelago, or the peninsulas of tropical Asia, or habitable Afdca, or the Antilles and forests of the New World, we have claimed or founded a home. The fairest regions, the most docile and industrious races, the most cardinal promontories, straits, and stations are ours. With so proud a p9sition, sitting apart and onhigh, yet girding the earth with the chain of our power, we have a right to some in­sular pride, and need take little heed of continental envy. Did the account of Britain's lofty titles and additions end here, wemight suppose thatposterity would have nothing else to do than to proclaim the splendour and beneficence of our em­pire. But it is wise to note betimes what posterity will see with noon-day distinct­ness, and to anticipate with amendment, if it be possible, the irreversible judg­ment of time. ls there no blot in thia gorgeous escocheon 1 Wisdom as well as candour will reply that there is. In all this great dominion, the work of ages and the fortunate result of many op­portunities, we have but few colonies, and scarce one worthy of our name. Amid the spoils of every clime Britain nowhere sees the likeness of herself. A true child of that majestic mother is not to be found. Much as we profess to value the tradi­tionary character of this kingdom, its happy admixture of various elements, its freedom tempered with reverence, and its practical usefulness dignified with con­ventional grandeur, we do not so much value these blessings as to carry them to our adopted homes. We have stocked plantations with slaves, we have occupied rocks with soldiers, and peopled solitudes with crime ; we have subjugated heathens with whose religion and manners we dare l}ot interfere ; .we have permitted, and even encouraged, misery, discontent, and vice to find a refuge within the range of our laws and the protection of our arms ; we have increased the nominal rent-roll of the empire by almost any compliance and at any expense; yet the Englishman who once embarks from these shores will never again see happy England till he returns. Lower Canada was-nay, is still, a province of France, and even re­tains that identity of usages and manners which at home th() revolution has des­troyed. Spain lives and flourishes again in South and Central .America. England alone is travestied and libelled in a neg­lected and degenerate progeny. The truth is, that with all our im­mense capabilities for the task, we never yet have attempted to colonize in a great and woxthy manner, We have scarcely yet put the question, What ought a British colony to be 1 Antiquity had left splendid examples ; in the diffusion of mankind and the spread of religion over the known world, there were pre­cedents enough for any possible require­ments ; and the discovery of a new world opened a field for the grandest designs. Our race is prolific, adventurous, and suc­cessful. Yet a certain fate has always stood in the way. England was not only the last maritime power of Europe that gained a footing in the New World, but was whole generations behindhand. During more than a century that elapsed from the day when COLUMBUS sent his brother to solicit the aid of HENRY VIL to the close of the TuDoR dynasty, the English Government gave itself no con­cern whatever, and contributed nothing whatever, except one or two useless and ridiculous charters, to the colonization of the opposite shores. Queen ELIZABETH defeated the Invincible .Armada, and re­ceived DRAKE on his return from a voy­age round the world ; but on the day of her death there was not a single English­man settled in America, The history of British America dates from the first year of JAMES I., but the private memoirs and ot~er wrHings of th~t and tbe SJ?,CCee<ling reigns prove how vamly the enhghtene«J. the noble, and the pious strove that Eng­land might be transplanted,such as she is,, in Church and in State, into her new pos­sessions. There exists a continuous chain of protests from the age of RALEIGH, HAKLUYT, and BACON down to the fatal year 1775, against the petty, grovelling, sordid spirit in which colonization was conducted. Traders, sailors, deserters: from the army, outcasts, convicts, slaves, the democratic and the fan&.tical, were the first and, for genen.tions, the only in­gredients of a society destined to elbow 111{ out of the New World, and even to beard us in the Old. It was truly a plantation or a settlement, but a colony it never was.. A crowd whom we had suffered to. gather to-. gether and grow up in absolute insulation from all the influences which form British society and are the life of the Britishi State, as soon as they were many andj strong enough renounced the authority oi a Government with which they had hardll! a sentiment or an instituti.oit in CODllllOJ,ij When that rude :md indigeste,d maas first lelt the instincts of political life, they were such as irresistibly drew it from the parent country. Hence the darkest page in British story ;-the darkest page as yet.; for, as we still pursue the same im­policy, perhaps a darker age is still to come. What is it that has preserved Canada to us thus far l Not anything it has de­rived from this country. Not political ,affinities. Not similarity of race. Not community of institutions. Not force of .arms.. To the. French origin"" of Canada we owe that it is ours. Social habits pre­,vailed over national antipathies ; and a primitive regime of seigniors, priests, and habitans stood by us, their recent con­querors, when our own flesh and blood abhorred us, and were driving us from the soil. Raise Canada to the level of England, and she is safe to our rule ; else-but it is needless to repeat what every one foresees ; which, however, the Legislature will not practically recognize. What man of rank, of wealth, of con­nexions, of generouB ambition, of superior attainme1Jts and capacity, will go to a country which is -not England, which he feels to be a banishment and a final ex­elusion from all that we prize in this country 1 Ask any one pining for oppor­tunities, and willing to run any risks for honourable advancement, why he does not see life and try his fortune in the colonies. He will answer that it is banish­ment ; colonial life is altogether low ; the utmost that a colonist can hope for is to get money, and so to fight his way back to the land of his birth. To fraternize with colonels and havetbe entree of mess­rooms, to make up. to functionaries and be one of a clique, is the height of colonial ambition. Thence there is no. return. The soldier bringA home his glory and promotion, but the founder of a town and the reclaimer of a forest, should he,wish to return, brings back nothing but his woney. There is the sure sign of a stigma. The degradation is irretrievable. A colonist can IJever be aught but a colonist-a better sort of backwoodsman. In England, the chairman of the sessions, the. county member, the millionaire, the keeper of a pack of hounds, the clever pleader or debater may rise to the peer­age,while baronetcies have been showered on the. humbler class of supporters and useful public men. A man who should give the QuEEN a province on the shores of Lake' Huron might sigh in vain for a place in the British roll of honour, It is not without reason and occasion that we endeavour to stir up the good sense and noble instincts of this country to an entirely new system of colonization, If little should be thought of, our opinions, the whole world is this year the spectator of a fact absolutely and utterly beyond all former precedent, and one which seems to call with a voice of thunder for measures to prevent its too probable recurrence, The population of British North America in 1844 was 1,851,241. Before the close of this present year nearly 100,000 per­sons, amounting to a twentieth of the existing population, will have arrived in the St. Lawrence, almost entirely from Ireland. Instead of that enormous im­migration representing in any degree whatever the wealth, the education, the rank, the habits, the loyalty, and the whole character of the mother country, they are to a man from the lower orders of Ireland. They represent, they carry with them, misery and degradation, a visionary temperament, a deep sense of injury, and a burning hatred of the British name. Centuries will not efface from their vindictive memories and their inventive imaginations the dark circum­stances of their,banishment, their passage, their landing, their dispersion over the inhospitable wild. Let any one read the extracts frolll' Canadian journals in our columns last Friday, and find a parallel, if he can, in any anrials. Is it possible that it should ever be forgotten 1 Tbtl!le hundr11d thousand, after the loss of thousands by disease on the passage; and as many more in hospital sheds, are forwarded up the river to Toronto, and thence to the upper provinces, still perishing, still scattering disease wherever thev go, and entirely de­pendent for support on the piety and alms of t.he benevolent. The clergy, the medi­cal men, and other charitable persons who have tendered to their wants, J:iave fallen by wholesale martyrs to that service. The Grand Jury of the Mayor's Court of Toronto has made a presentment, showing that the city is no longer capable of bear­ing the increasing burden thrown on its resources, and offering too valid reasons to apprehend that the myriads passed upwards, at this period of the year, will perish miserably by the way. Such is British colonization under the present system, or rather want of system alto-. gather. ;what else is. to be expected than a demoralized and disaffected population, a lost colony, and an aggrandized rival 1 And whom have we to thank for these in­evitable results 1","(LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1847,)",2,10/5/1847
"ENGLAND’S AID TO IRISH DISTRESS. {LEADING ARTICLE, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1847.) The humanity of the British people does not require a defence at our hands. It is known by its fruits. In no country is public opinion so quick to the impulses either of indignation or of pity. In England, at least, the meanest wretch carinot fall to the ground without compassion and inquiry ; and, except by some untoward accident,by some singular neglect er oppression, or by the temporary harshness of some newly broached theory, no one need lack proper food, clothes, or shelter for a day. It l:ms been our painful t~uty to bring to light the excep tions to this general account of our national benevolence. We have also had to deplore the peculiar degradation of the poor in this or that district. But the public opinion of this cour,~ry, the voice and soul of the ed'll.cated classes, is ready to bear any burden and make any sacri­fice when a manifest obligation is to be discharged, or. benefit to be done. Though it deposed a Ministry on the question of a paltry list of sinecure pensions, it has since voted away millions to succour the victims of famine, or slavery, or political c,ppression. To that public opinion we have appealed, not wHhout a degree of success, for the rights of Celtic industry, and the relief of Celtic destitution. To the public opinion of this country Ireland owes that happy foundation of better days, the Act of last session, "" to make furtner provision for the relief of the destitute poor in Ireland."" It matters little what calumnies the avowe!! enemies of this people and-, state may propagate against England. Her deeds are before the whole world. With all her faults, she is generous aii she is great ; and no one will ever persuade thjl enlightened and the truthful that she if! otherwise. We do not, therefore, fear the imputa­tion of inhumanity when we say that public opinion is decidedly adverse to this repeated "" begging"" for Ireland. It is not that any doubt exists as to the reality of Irish distress, and. the necessity of strong and timely measures of relief, Something must be done, and more must be done than l!as yet been.done for Ireland, but the more this is felt, and the more the calamities and perplexities .of that ill-fated country attract our sympathy and stimulate our speculation, the more it is felt that importunate appeals to the benevolent are not the right way of meet­ing a case of permanent and in,eterate national degradation. The most positive assurances are given, indeed, that the "" alms"" of this country are not solicited for national, but local destitution, and not to the exclusion of. that regular system of relief now happily afforded by the law. A letter by Sir JoHN BURGOYNE, which we publish this day, is designed to show the place which the thank-offerings of our churches are to fill in the scheme of relief. The great drifts of population cast and pent up on the promontories of the west, and occu-, pying almost a fifth of 'the island, are said to present a mass of poverty beyond the power of any local resoµrces, however taxed, to relieve. Famine is about to re­new its attack on these devoted shores. The one chance of the people has again failed, and a few months will bring back the desolation of last year. Nay, the argument goes further than this. The potato being destroyed, or given up, it is impossible to say when the West of Ire-, !_and will be able to exist by its own; industry and on its own resources. .Af;; present, there are neither crops for the tenant, nor rents for the proprietor, nor alms for the poor, not can H be said when' there will .be again. It is simply the; case of a vast population crowded in a: narrow sp ace, without either food or the means of production or purchase-a diffi­culty which does not admit of speedy self­extrication. Sir JoHN Bu:aaoYNE must perm~t us to say ~hat he .Pr<;>ve11 too much . By his own showmg, this 1s not a case for temporary or occasional alms, but £or comprehensive plans and permanent insti­tutions. You have a law. Do your best to. carry it out. Let thi~ 1le your. first ob-: ject. All ar.,-,eals to private charity merely. tend t, rt from your only proper course. 1, y tend to relax the honesty of ratepay rs and guardians and the ac­ tivity of collectors. Under the pretence of expected alms, rates will be resisted, Do not give up any portion of Ireland by wholesale, but mak every union do its duty. The qnestion is not the competency of certain towns, or small districts, buu of extensive unions three or four timer larger than our own. On the old English principle of ""rates in aid,"" adopted into the Act of last session the expenses of every electoral division over and above15d. inthe pound for each half-year are to fall on the union atlarge. Take the very worst case in all Ireland. The union of Skibbereen contained,in 1841,a population of 104,508. Its area, however, amounts to 236,000 .statute acres, and its Poor Law valuation -on the ;profits, not on the produce of the land-is £98,255, while of the occu­piers of land, considerably more than half hold 1p.ore than ten acres, 2,421 hold between 20 and 50 acres,420 hold between 50 and 100 acres, 91 hold between 100 and .. 200 acres, 13 hold between 200 and 500, and five hold between 500 and 1,000 .acres, Here is the very worst cass in all Ireland-the refuge and resort of all the outcasts in Munster, We see nothing hopeless in this_disposition of people and land, At any rate, carry out the law as far as it will go. When you have pro­ceeded so far that any further pressure on the resources of the union will be evi­dently ruinous, and will defeat the ends of humanity, let the Legislature,­ ssembled.for the purpose, if you please­pant present relief, and devise some iJermanent remedy. We will answer for_ it, that when a case for national assistance is clearly made, Eng}and will not be backward to help th& weaker members of the commonweal. ( -There is no assistance, no confidence, that England will not be ready to grant the Minister who shows that he_ is pre­pared to govern Ireland with the eye and the hand of a master. It will strengthen his hands to establish order, and fit them to reward and develop it. As soon as it shall see that he can use extra­ordinary powers neither to oppress the peasant nor to aggrandize the landlord, that he can administer bounties without jobbing, and transplant Britis~ capital so effectually that it shall take abiding root in Irish soil, England will consent to almost any drain on its resources and any stretch of its constitutional usages. It is prepared to make great efforts for that wayward and self-tormenting, but still unfortunate people, It is aware that nothing but a participation in the for­tunesandprosperity of the sister island can rescue Ireland from its degrading bondage to fanatics, incendiaries, and charlatans, from the disciples of M'HALE, the myrmidons of O'CONNELL, the followers of DOHENY and LALOR, and the murderers of RoE. It knows that an extensive island cannot be redeemed from ill­culture, and a people from indolence, superstitution, and crime, without the most heroic devotion of labour and of means.

Bur­tion, hotb '\ffitten and oral, from all goyne,. that .it was impossible that the habits of the people could be so suddenly changed, and new modes of subsistence so suddenly established, as to allow of the crowded population which has grown up under the potato system supporting themselves without assistance in the second year after the failure. And Thirdly,-That the change from an idle, barbarou_s, isolated potato cultiva­tion, to corn culbivation, which enforces industry, binds together employer and employed in mutually beneficial relations, and, requiring capital and skill for its successful prosecution, supposes the exis­tence of a class of substantial yeomanry who have ari interest in preserving the good order. of society, is proceeding as fast as can reasonably be expected under the circumstances ; and that if the rich and highly-favoured portions of the em­pire give some further temporary assist­ance to these distressed sections of our population, to enable them to ""tide over"" the shoals upon which they have fallen, the harbour will, ere long, be attained. If you consider my testimony on these points of any public value on the present occasion, you are at liberty to make any use of it'yon think proper ; and it is Sir fohn Burgoyne's intention that his paper should be published with his name, which, considering the accurate infor­mation he has ohtained in the manage­ment of the Relief Commission, cannot fail to carry great weight with it. Believe me, Sir, yours very faithfully, C. E. TREVELYAN. Salt-hill Hotel, near Dublin, Oct. 7. Sir,-Notwithstanding the impatience expressed at the dernan~s for Ireland, we must still, in common charity, afford her considerable assistance. Distress still hangs over that country, from which she is quite unable to relieve herself. It is not the ordinary distress of a lowering of the condition of people from one of luxury or comfort, but it is the 'reducing them from the lowest state that can sup­port life to one without means even to do that. Absolute famine still stares whole districts in 'the face, and we must not allow ourselves to become callous to the horrors of such an evil because we have had it before us for any given period( But it is said th.at it is their owrl fault, and originates in an erroneous and improvident system ; supposing it to be so, are we ,to allow tlwusands to die of starvation because they were enabled by Providence to subsist previously; for almost ages, on an erroneons'systemj The only other argument against ex, traneous relief is that the country ought to be called upon to make sacrifices to relieve itself, 1:1,nd that the property of Ireland must support its poverty--a just maxim under ordinary circumstances, and one that has been adopted by the Legis­lature in the provisions of the New Poor Law. That law, being duly carried out, will compel all who can contribute for the support of the poor to do so in proportion to their means, and will reduce the de­mand on others to what cannot possibly be met by that provision. The extent. of the effect of the loss of the potato in Ireland, however, is still not perfectly understood, particularly as affects all whose income was dependent on the land, up to the greatest proprietors. The great mass of a dense popu­lation spread over the face of the country lived, as is well known, on the potato. A family once located on from one to three or four acres of land was provided for ; a cabin could be raised in a few days without the expense of a sixpence I the potatoes, at the cost of a very little labour, supplied them with a sufficiency of a food with which from habit they were perfectly content ; and a pig, or with some, a cow, or donkey, or pony, and occasional labour at a very low rate of wages, gave them what was requisite to pay a rent, and for such clothing and other articles as were absolutely neces­ sary, and which with a great proportion were on the lowest scale of human exis­ tence. The foundation of the whole, how­ ever, was the possession of the bit of land; it was the one, and the only one, thing absolntelynecessary;therentconsequently was ,high, and generally well paid, being the first demand on all the money re­ ceived, in order to secure that essential tenure, and only what remained became applicable to the other objects .Although of the lowest grade, it was an easy mode of subsistence; and led to the encourage­ ment of early marriages, large familie~ and a rapidly increasing population ; arul at the same time afforded the proprietof & very good return of profit for his land.. We can hardly wonder at the continuan0$ of this improvident system, as it has been called. The entire loss of the potato in 1846 threw this whole class into absolute destitution ; whatever little means could, be obtained went for food rthousands dieq of want, and of course not a shilling al rent could be raised among them, thQ spreading distress tct many sup%~ cll!,sses. The next to these were the s farmers who cultivated from 6 to 20 or 30 acres, and may be supposed to have been exempt from being much affected by the calamity, but were. not so. They were, in fact, without capital ; the food for themselves, families, and dependents was still the potato ; thAy had a cow or two, perhaps a pony and a cart, and two or three pigs. Their farming was of the most slovenly description, and their sell­ing produce, after paying their rent, afforded a little better clothing and a little more of comforts than enjoyed by the cot­tiers. Still the main stay was the potato. When that went, everything else at the disposition of this class was required for food, and with a great number was in­sufficient ; the payment of rent was not only impossible, but all the little stock and. other means for future continu>J,nce of their habitual occupation were disposed of ; and a great number of this class were added t.o the absolutely destitute. Here again is experienced another falling off ; for these constituted the lower rate­payers, whose contributions for support­ing the poor can not only no longer be looked to, but who will themselves, many of them, add to the number of paupers to be supported. The extent to which these two-classes were affected by the loss of the potato may be estimated by the numbers that it was found necessary to furnish with mere food for many months in 1847,. which at one time amounted to 3,000,000 individuals. It is usual to comiider the property in Ireland generally as fairly chargeable with the remedy for the result of this calamity after the first helping hand given to it, but it cannot be so adjusted. Jn all parts the evil has been felt, but in some much more intensely than in others. On all the eastern side of Ireland, from north to south, the proximity to the English markets induced a greater culti­ vation of produce for barter, and there are more farmers, graziers, &c., inde­ pendent of such an article as the potato. although there fs mixed up with them a large number of cottiers ; but even these latter have in some degree more resources in available means for the application of their labour. These districts, therefore, tllay reas<inabl).'. be required .to make the Jl81J""essary sacrifices .to struggle through the difficulty, and may comprehend, perhaps, four-fifths of the country, but lihe remain ing fifth-that along the west of Ireland-remains in a most deplorable condition, and has not within itself the possible power of relief. The west of Ireland is far removed from markets, and it would require the judi­cious application of much capital, and under more favourable circumstances than Ireland has yet afforded, to raise it from its late condition of mere self-supportingexist­ence. The consequence has been that these western counties are almost entirely occu­pied by the cottiers and small holders above described,not only arising from their backward state as regards the production of articles.for barter, but encouraged by another casual circumstance in the nature of the coast, which being in deep gulfs and inlets, supplied them with an abun­dance of sea weed, which applied to the land was peculiarly favourable to the pro pagation of the potato. Hence the great body of the people there are now without food, and the few above them without the rents which could supply their only means of relieving the rest. In other countries one interest may come to the relief of another ; the farmer may reliove the manufacturer and thti merchant, and vice versa, as the case re­quires it ; but in Ireland there is but one interest, being that in the produce of the land. It may be assumed, perhaps, that the people having now gone through the periods of dearth of the last two years, ought to be sufficiently provided for by the abundant produce of the present season. Undoubtedly the especial hand of Pro­vidence has been thus mercifully ex­tended towards the relief of the people, in a manner that will greatly mitigate the general distress, but it st.ill leaves a large amount absolutely requiring a great extent of human and humane exertion. .Although the potatoes have succeeded better this year tban on the two former, not above ope-sixth of the usual quantity has been planted, and that not by the small occupiers, as usual for their sup­port, because the case appeared hopeless, and even otherwise the seed was wanting. The lands of many were ill adapted to other crops, or they had no means of tilling them ; or even where they had put in turnips or oats, &c'., the produce will be quite insufficient for their sup­port, for it must be observed that it re~ ,quires three times the quantity of land laid out in corn to what would be necessary in potatoes to feed for the year any given number of persons. Thus it must plainly appear that Ire­land in all parts is still in much distress, but along the west very active and ex­tended benevolence is required to be exerted from elsewhere to prevent the most horrible scenes ; that this calamity must be the effort, of all parties to intro­is continuous, and can only be gradually duce and to accelerate. by a new order in the social Dublin, Oct. 6. ,T.

"(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1847:) removed system, which it will be tl10 interest, and Sir,-It is with feelings of no slight oatisfaction that I see now daily evidences through the English press, that the Eng­lish people are beginning rightly to appre­ciate the true cause of the "" poverty "" of the Irish. It is a satisfaction to me, because I may pardonably hope that the seed which, when in Ireland, I laboured to sow through your columns is at last beginning to bring forth fruit. .For some days past letters have ap­peared in your columns from many clergymen of the Church of England, _ex­pressing a unanimous feeling of indigna­tion thflt they should again becalled upon to solicit alms from their congregations on behalf of "" the poor aud starving Irish ;"" and your paper of this day con­tains a long letter from Sir J. Burgoyne, deprecating that burst of honest indigna­tion at the impudent appeal, and putting forth some reasons why there should be a further contribution of alms from England to ""the poor and starving Irish,"" but con­fined locally to places on the western coast. To .have refused eleemosynary relief to a fdistressed people when those .among them who were in want could not obtain food by law from the community of .those who had enough and to spare, whilst the law punished them as criminals if they took that food by force, would have been a manifest cruelty and injustice. The common principles of humanity and equity forbade us to stay our hands ; and, however much our judgments might deprecate the means of relief employed, it was ::ontrary to our nature to compel or permit helpless people to starve. The Legislature has, however, at length remedied that wrong ; it has granted a first instalment of enlightened legislation to Ireland, aespite the determined oppo­sition of Irishmen to the boon, and has at length declared to be law that first principle of equitable rule, that while it professes to enforce obedience to the laws which protect property, it at the same time will not suffer men to be tempted by want beyond human endur­ance to break those laws, but will give them a right, if in destitution, to sufficient relief to support life from the common.stock of the local com~unity. Having advanced thus far in the c1v1 lized government of Ireland, appeals to our humanity for the ""poor and starving Irish "" no longer have any just founda­tion. We have a right to repel the claim, as -it is now being repelled ; nay, more, when the true causes of that "" poverty and starving "" condition of "" the Irish "" are beginning at length to be in some degree appreciated in England, indus­trious, and painstaking, and enterprising Engli&hmen, who "" earn their bread by the sweat of their brows,"" have a right to re:riel the claim with indignation and scorn. Sir J. Burgoyne, in his letter of reasons for giving assistance to the Irish, thus truly describes their condition :­ "" The great mass of a dense population spread over the face of the country lived, as is well known, on the potato. A familv once located on from one to three or four acres of land was provided for­a cabin could be raised in a few <lays, without the expense of a sixpence ; the potatoes at the cost of~a very little labour, supplied them with a sufficiency of food with which from habit they were perfectl:y: content ; and a pig, or with some a cow, or donkey, or pony, and occasional labour at a very low rate of wages, gave theIQ what was requisite to pay a rent, and for such clothing and other article~ as were absolutely necessary, and which, with a. great proportion, were on the lowest scale of human existence. The foundation o~ the whole, however, was the possession of the bit of land. It was the one, and the only one, thing absolutely necessary~ The rent consequently was high, and gene­rally well paid; being the first demand o)l all mon6'V received, in order to securQ that essential tenure, and only what re, mained became applicable to the other objects. Although of the lowest grade! it was an easy mode of subsistence and lea to the encouragement of early marriages, large families, and a rapidly increasing population ; and .at the same time afforded the proprietor a very good returl;l of profit for his land. We can hardly wonder at the c011tinuance of this impr~ vident sy1;1tem, as it has been called."" He then proceeds to describe the COI\: / dition of the small farmers of 20 to 30 acres of land, and says,­ ""_Their}arming was of the mostslovenly description, and their selling produce, after paying their rent, afforded a little better clothing and a little more of com­forts tha n enjoyed by the cottiers."" There are inen (and the cou11_sels of such appear, unfortunately, to have pre­vailed in4 the government of Ireland) upon whom all opportunities of observation are thrown away. There are men who cannot read human nature though the index point never so plainly. There are well-in­tentioned men who, by a kind of perverse ingenuity or impenetrable stolidity, will stumble on the most mischievous remedies for any evil. What does all this painfully faithful description of Sir J. Burgoyne indicate, but the universal prevalence of contented laziness and apathy and want of enterprise amongst the Irish people? A ""few days' "" labour, without a "" sixpence expense,"" procures the Irish cottier his cabin ; "" a very little labour supplies him with a sufficiency of potatoes for food,"" with which he is '' perfectly content;"" and "" occasional labour "" pays his rent and buys his clothes ! What ! and is the Dorsetshire peasant and the Suffolk labourer, towhom twelve hours of daily labour the yearround scarcely affords sufficient bread, and who has more than once within recent recol­lection been rendered desperate by the insufficiency of the pittance of 7s. a-week, the price of his litbour, to pay £2 or £3 rent for his cottage and to provide bread for his family, to be asked by his clergy­man to contribute liis mite for the ""poor and starving_ Irish,"" who live habitually contented with the cottages and the food with which "" a very little occasional labour,"" supplies them ? icBut the response is, they are starving. ~ey cannot now starve by law-; there is, ~h~refore, an end of that plea. But it is said they are wretchedly poor and dis­'tressed. Our answer is, let them work jl,s we do, and their poverty wi11 become iVealth,-and their distress will be changed into abundance. But it is replied, "" Give them time, and they will work better presentl:t."" _Give time to a people to oluntar1ly mcrease the a;mount of their E bour who for ages have "" been content "" p live on potatoes I The proposition,_rries on the face of it a contradiction. l'otatoes ~re got with "" a very little 1a.bour -;'~ little more labour, voluntarily given_, :would have procuredthe:m a better Jqocl;.,-a:r:;_(\!'fO_ll,l<l!i,a.v..e made the ""slovenl_y ....:;,,...._ farms"" yield a better return-would, in fact, have been the first voluntary step out of poverty and wretchedness towards comfort and independence. But that voluntary step has never been taken. Why ? Because the Irish people pre­ferred poverty and wretchedness and dependence, with"" a very little labour,"" to comfort, and independence, and wealth, with hard work. And it is ex­pected that they will take that voluntary step now, if we ,mly subscribe alms enough to provide them meanwhile with a sufficiency of food l Oh, admirable in­sight into human nature !-Oh, perfect conception of the Irish character ! It did require, in times past, "" a very little labour "" to procure them the most wretched subsistence, wherewith '..they were "" content ; "" give them that subsist­eDJ;,e without any labour at all,and think you not that still therewith they will be "" content ? "" It is apparent that if "" a little labour "" would procure sub­sistence to an Irishman, hard work (to which Englishmen are accustomed, and to which, for the sake of the benefits which accrue to them from it, they volun­tarily yield themselves) would have pro­cu-red something beyond mere subsist­ence ; the continually accumulating value of which surplus produc.tion over consumption would long since have changed the poverty of Ireland into , wealth. And it is as apparent, as Irish­men were "" content "" with a wretched existence procured by "".a very little labour,"" that the necessity of doing some­thing for existence was alone the spur to that "" very little labour ;"" for when the necessities of the merest animal existence were supplied the "" very little labour "" ceased-; they were ""content."" with a mud hut and potatoes. It was the spur of necessity alone that drove them to "" a very little labour."" The necessity was small ; the labour was proportioned to it. It has pleased God to visit their land with a famine in .a particular kind of food. Their land, with industry, will grow abundance of all kinds of food, far beyond anything that the land of Eng­land will yield. The spur of necessity to labour by the providence of God, which ought in truth to be regarded as a bless­ing, has been increased .to the people of Ireland. If the labour of the ~l_Jeople, urged on by this necessity, be given, there is no shadow of doubt but the return will be sufficient for their wants. But experience teaches us that they will not. vol,untarily give this labour without the spur of necessity ; their "" content­ment "" with mud huts and potatoes, with "" a very little labour,"" proves this. What, then, do we,-in our mistaken humanity, propose to do 1 With a stupid blindness to the character of this people, under the name of "" charity to the poor Irish,"" we would thwart the providence of God,-we would lighten that necessity under the pressure of which, and to meet which, they alone will work,-we would, in fact, cast the greatest stumbling-block that the most perverse ingenuity could devise (looking at the character of the people) towards the progress of the coun­try out of that ""slovenly cultivation '' and that misery and wretchedness with which, and ""little labour,"" the people are"" content;"" we would degrade them into "" contentment "" with subsistence on charity. But it is only the people on the western coast, says Sir J. Burgoyne, who will want this assistance; those on the eastern coast, from their proximity to England, have a _market for their produce, are better off, and can pay rates. The people _on the eastern coast are better off, because they are more industrious, and they -are more industrious because they -have amongst them a large admixture of men of English blood, who have trans­planted among them the characteristics of their race-industry and enterprise. The qualities wanted to make the people of thll west of Ireland as prosperous, are simply industry and enterprise. Will giving them English alms and supporting them on charitable donations promote ,either of those qualities 1 They will take our alms and live thereon in "" content."" One other step by the Legislature in the right direction will leave the west of ,Ireland without the shadow of an excuse _if it does not: progress at equal pace with any other part of the United Kingdom. Pnce let the Legislature facilitate the transfer of land, and the sale of mort­,gag13d estates-once let them admit men of capital to the responsible ownership_of the soil, and get rid of the present help­~essness, of nominal landlords without power, of receivers in Chancery, taking the responsibility of the lords of the soil, and of absent and irresponsible capita0 lists, oo mortgagees carrying .off without return or care the usufruct of ""the land; and the opportunities will oe afforded for the development of industry. At present -and I d~ not speak as a mere theoTist, for I have been over every part ofit, from Dunfanaghy Head, in Donegal, to Cape Clear, in Cork-the west of Ireland is a disgrace to the British empire, for its neglected capabilities and its poverty and wr~tchedness, in the face of every natural advantage that can lead to wealth. There are to be found neglected the finest harbours, magnificent rivers, and an almost continuous succession of lakes affording natural water ca1Tiage of the cheapest kind, unlimited water power, rich and discovered mines, thousands of uncultivated acres, and a sea teeming with fish. The harbours are unfre­quented ; the Shannon impresses you with melancholy at its vast and deserted expanse ; the lakes are unused, except by an occasional turf-boat; no water-wheel betokens industry ; the minerals are unwon ; the land is a dreary-looking waste; while Cornishmen almost alone fish the coast, in the sight of the "" starv­ing Irish!"" What, surely, here is wanted but enter­prise and industry among the people to win the wealth which so temptingly in~ vites them to labour ! Yet, what must we propose to deaden their impulses to either, but-to support them on charity ! Oh, let every man who loves Ireland sternly refuse to advances to her one penny, and compel her,(in spite of herself, to do more than ""labour a very little"" to convert into many sources of wealth her almost boundless natural advantages ; and let every soft-hearted Englishman impelled by his humanity to contribute a sovereign for the relief of "" the starv­ing Irish,"" feel assured oL this, that he has contributed towards the removal of that necessity which will alone impel the Irish of the western coast to work, and in so doing has helped to perpetuate their poverty and wretchedness and their de,, . grading "" content."" ,. Pray excuse this long letter, impelled by your paper of to-day, from one who, as your former "" Commissioner "" in Ire;. land, had perhaps unexampled opportu­nities of studying the character of its people, and whilst admiring their virtue!!, of not being blinded to their faults ; and, believe me to remain very faithfully yours, T.

"IRISH EMIGRATION. .(LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 11347.) ,.Of the many trials to which human nature is exposed, we can imagine none more severe than to set an Irish proprie­tor to write on the subject of emigration. There is something so delightful in the idea of a good human current setting strong from an estate up to the neck in mortgages and men, rates and rent­resisters, that it makes a landlord almost beside himself with longing. His land of promise, flowing with milk and honey, is British America, not, of course, for him­self, as he still cleaves to the flesh-pots of Egypt, but for his tenants and squatters. If Heaven, indeed, should please to take them, that would be the most satisfactory of all possible events ; but as Heaven does not often take a million at a time, Canada, or, indeed, any place either beyond or at the bottom of the sea, will do quite as well. Were the Canaan for oneself, one would not be content without actually getting there ; but where it is for others, as in this instatice, a few trifling casualties .on the way, a few thousand sta-rved, or rotted, or drowned, do not much signify. In fact, if the whole indigenous population of Ireland were simultaneously to pack up their kneading troughs, and Eet off for Canada, we are inclined to believe that the land­lords, having the fate of PHARAOH before their eyes, would not order out their chariots and try to bring them back. Such of our readers as perused the report of the Committee appointed by the Lords, on the subject of Colonization from Ireland, will recognize in that really very clever and interesting document the coulewr de rose we are speaking of. One could' almost imagine that a religious questiO'll was involved in the matter, and. that the writers were a committee of JoE $:MITH's elders setting forth the saving efficacy of a journey to Nauvoo. There are, indeed, some rathllr ugly rumours of happiness not wholly unmixed, and order not wholly undisturbed, on the banks of the St. Lawrence. Onlv half-a-dozen years since we had to reconquer the colony. Wherever the Irish constitute a majority, as in Newfoundland, they give us, on that minor theatre, a repetition of the performance which has won such applause on the boards of old Ireland. In the United States there is rather a strong feeling on the subject, and the Union is almos-.; tor11 asunder by the con fiict between the Irish and their bitter opponents. The most serious aspect of the matfor is its effect on the security of the British character of our American poss;,ssions. May Canada long be ours ! May we long possess the northern and the eastern shores of those magnifi­cent lakes ! May there long be a place not quite as far as the Antipodes, and in a better neighbourhood than Caffres and cannibals ""once removed,"" where British enterprise may find room .to expand, British JJoverty may find a retreat, and British disappointment a new start in the race ! How long wiH that continue the case when three-fourths of our American colonists shall be of Celtic ex­traction, the produce 0£ a continual out­pouring of 'Irish calamity, and when nothing but a river full of steamers shall separate the -colony from an ambitious neighbour, perbaps actually at war with us in every quarter of the w_orld 1 The ""Irish Proprietor,"" whose letter we give in another plMe, exemplifies the almost morbid jealousy with -which the class regards anything that can possibly check the great Celtic migration. Nothing can be less tothe purpose than his sermon to its te-x:t. We last week called the attention of our readers to the very un­worthy character.of British colonization, and urged every rationnl attemptto make the colonies true children of the parent society, like in privilege aud rank, like in prospects and wealth. To elevate the colonies by all the mea~s at the disposal of the Legislature and the Crown seemed to us the most Hk-ely .method ofattracting thither the rank, the education, the capi­tal, the enterprise, and, in their train, the population of these. islands. Unless Canada, for -example, .could be made thoroughly British in condition, in tastes, in habits, in institutions, and even in pre­judices, as well as in name and in1aw, lamentable but most instructive prece~ dents justified the apprehension that it might not long be ours. We then ad­verted to the unparalleled character of this year's migration from Ireland ;-an army, or rather a :flight of a hundred thousand souls, driven over the ocean by famine and pestilence,andwithout homes, or employment, or any other preparation for their settlement. We sa.1d of them, in the merest pity, and with reference to the misery of their lot, "" Instead of that enormous immigration representing, in any degree whatever, the wealth, tho education, tho rank, the habits, the loyalty, and the whole character of the mother country, they are to a man from the lower orders of Ireland."" That, we presume, cannot well be dmied. It may be our lack of information, but we cer­tainly have not heard of many gentlemen of fortune, many "" Irish proprietors,"" many savans , or scholars, many right honourables, many persons of taste and refinement, many gentlemen distinguished for their public services, among those hundred thousand. We very much qu€s­tion whether th€re was even one substan­tial tradesman or half-a-doz£n large farmers in the number. We shall be only too happy to be assured we are wrong. Continuing to speak of th:se hundred thousand persons, of whcse sufferings we have lately read such heart-rrnding accounts, we said, "" They reprrncnt, they carry with them, misery and degradation, a visionary temperammt and a factious religion, a deep sense of injury and a burning hatred of tho British name."" We then d wclt on the horrors of their passage, their disembarcation, the gigantic laza­rettos in which they there perished by thousands,and the still further calamities which awaited them on their dispersion into the interior. It was natural to in­quire after this, "" What else is to be ex­pected than a demoralized and disaffected population, a lost colony and an aggran­dized rival? And whom have we to thank for these i:nevitable resnlts ? "" On this text tho "" Irish Proprietor "" writes a rather warm epistle. Does he, however, deny our statements, or attempt to re­move our appreheD1:1ions 1 No ; he <lorn not dispute a word. He ventures, indeed, on a greater misrepresentation. He says we "" abuse the po or emigrants."" If we 11,bused anybody, we abused the British Government, and that state of British society which induced such lamentable events as the emigration of this season. He says, again, that we would shut both England and the colonies against the Irishman, and intimates that we woµld leave him only CROMWELL'S alternative. That is not only unfair, but wholly at variance with the letter and purport of what we wrote. We wished that the Irish should be drawn rather than driven to Caiiada-that rank, wealth, education, and such invariable ingredients of .British society should, if possible, be associated with numbers, poverty, and ignorance. If what we call society is a real and a happy thing ; if gentility is not an impo­sition, and knowledgi, folly ; if the con­dition of England is better than the con dition of Ireland,and it is worth Ireland's while itself to be wealthier, then certainly a multitude of a hundred thousand small farmers, cottiers, labourers, aud mendi­cants fleeing across the Atlantic within half a year, with less preparation and providence than any such number of wanderers ever enjoy£d before, is a very great and an ominous misfortune. It bodes no good to England. That unhappy multitude lands under evil auspices. All the blessing it carries with it is, "" Your room rather than your company."" It owes nothing to the country it leaves. It cannot but remember the story of its banishment. Do we "" abuse the poor emigrant "" in all this as the "" Irish Pro­prietor "" alleges 7 No ; we pity and be­frirnd him. We ask for an improved system of colonization, worthier of the British name. Then, why does the "" Irish Proprietor"" call us so angrily to account i Because by holding up the dark side of the picture he £Ears we may discourage emigration; Bis jealousy for the character of the "" poor emigrants"" we really believe to be nothing more thau anxiety to get rid of them. He is anxious to s~ize the oppor­tunity, which we willingly afford, of pub­lishing the generally successful and re­spectable career of the Irish settler. Bis collection of evidence on this point, how­eyer, is perfectly gratuitous. We never aenied that when the Irish do settle in Canada they almost invariably get on well. We have said on a former 0ccasion, that though they do not, at first, make good agriculturaf servants, they do better as .independent settlers than the Eng""Jish labourer, trained as the latter bas. been only to service. But many of the Irish do not settle anywhere ; they become "" canallers"" or ""navigators,"" and exhibit in that employment much the same pecu­liarities of character as at home. Many of them pass through to the States, and become violent politicians, particularly when England is in question. This is a rEsult we should do well to anticipate, if we can.

"(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, THURSDA.Y, OCTOBER 14, 1847.) Sir,-Even when I differ from you I cannot help reading your observations with the greatest interest. But you must allow me to say that you deal somewhat too severely with all classes at this side of the Channel, whether an Anglo-Irish­man, like myself, or the "" merus Hiber­nicits"" who rejoices in a patronymic com­mencing with "" 0 "" or "" Mac."" It is on this very account, however, that I think you will be the more disposed to give some attention to opinions somewhat op­posed to your own. Your love of justice will compel you, at the least, to examine them. If you so far favour me as to notice them in your journal, they will at least have the charms of no\ elty and variety for your readers, who are not accustomed to find in your columns any defence or apology for Ireland. This will enable you to return to your usual tone of general and sweeping condemnation with somewhat more of zest and relish. Yo'ur readers, too, will be refreshed by this momentary change of key and variety of m,odulation. I do not ask you to r2ad or to accept any defence of Irish landlords. I do.not ask vou to tolerate Concilia.tion­hall, Irish councils, or Irish confedera­tions. The truth is, I can hardly tolerate theip myself. But you have lately pub­lished some severe strictures on the character and conduct of the poor Irish emigrants, and it is on their behalf that I take the freedom of addressing you ; and I am inclined to hope that you will not be the less inclined to favour me with some attention because those whom I defend are tbe poor, the weak, and the unprotected. No one can charge you with being indifferent to this class or -indis­posed to listen to their appeal. You have most strongly denounced our peasantry if they make their way to Eng­ land ; and where they spread poverty and disease in your more fortunate country, I am not astonished at your opposition and alarm. You attack us, likewise, on our conduct and social state at home ; and if no vigorous efforts are made by ourselves, honestly and boldly to improve it, I am willing to admit the justice of your cen­ sure. But you are now endeavouring to describe the Irish emigrants as nuisances in our distant possessions ; and it is ou this point that I wish you, for the present at least, to pause and hesitate before you promulgate opinions which I think I can prove to you would be as unjust as _they would be cruel. But, Sir, consider if excluded from Englaud, if condemned at home, and if refused admittance to the colonies, where it is that you would wish us to turn. Cromwell, it is true, offered to the Irish an alternative for Connaugqt ; but this you decline to mention "" to ears polite."" You rather adopt the course which is de­scribed in that memorable, though perhaps apocryphal epistle called the "" Tears of the Britons."" "" The sea,"" ob­served your ancestors, "" drives us on the barbarians, and the barbarians on the sea."" It is so witl\ you. You seem to be determined to meet us wherever we seek refuge, and your ""Shut, Sesame !"" is spoken at every door where we ask admis­sion. I appeal from, what seems to me, a hasty and erroneous judgment, to conclu­sions which are to be deduced from evi­dence open to no cavil or suspicion:--the evidence, not of Irish writers or ldsh proprietors, but of sworn witnesses con­nected with-our colonies and identified with their best interests. Among the many topics adverted to in the huge hlue book which bears the title of ""The Report on Colonization,"" printed by th& House of Lords in the last session, the character and conduct of the Irish emigrants in our colonies are prominent subjects of special examination I shall not rely on the testimony of the witnesses from Ireland, but I beg to call your atten­tion to the following .extracts from the colonial evidence, as beiug c.onclusive in my favour. I shall not only refer to my authorities by name, bup shall give you likewise the number of each answer, that you may b_e enabled to detect any want of fairness or candour in my mode of <lea.Jing with the subject, should I be justly liable to any such imputation, Mr. Porley, the emigration agent and commissioner of Indian afiairs in New Brunswick is asked ( Question 165 ), ""What has been the conduct of the Irish emi­grants on the whole 1 Has it been peace­able, orderly, or the reverse 1"" And the answer is, "" I think I can safely answer that question in the affirmative. The Irish have conducted themselves veri well in the province of New Brunswick. ' I may here remark, that this is the result of no slight experience; for out of 9,600 emigrauts who arrived in New Brunswick in-a single year, 9,500 came from Ireland (Quest.ion 133) ; and ofthis vast multitude Mr. Porley had better means of judging tfum any other individual, being brought in contact with them personally and offi­cia.Hy. But you may say that his reply is -vague, and that dol1ts versafatr in gene­""J"".a.liilrns. Let us, the-refore, in the language t>f the Scotch law, ""condescend to particu­la:ri;.""He describ.es (225)an Irish settlement formed from Cork and Kerry, in 1842, antl ipforms us-"" W,here but two years ago stood a dense forest, there have been ,rathered by 35 settlers, during the past IUllllumn, 7,236 bushels of gmin, potatoe(3, :and turnips. An .accompanying return :shows an estimated value ef £1,137 in buildings and clearings ; and when. to this .a added the marke.t value ,;,f the crops, exceeding £800, we have above £2,000 i'eturn, which, in its wilderness .state, would not have prcduced one shilling."" Mr. Uniaclrn, a member of the Colonial bgiisbture, describing the colony of Nova J3eoti:~, states (458)-"" The Irish, gene­mlly .speaking, conduct themselves ex­il-emely well. Thoso who live in tho in­teciot and become settlers are a remark­ably yell-conducted class. Of course, among those hanging about tho. towns, .thereare some. worthless, who get a worsl'l ,nu:me for the whole class than they .deserve."" Mr. Uniacke, then, like Mr. Porley, illustrates liis general statement by a more precise example, the more valu­able as it i,; taken from the country which bo,has worthily represented in tho Pro­vincial Parliament for 17 years. "" A number ~f Irish,"" be informs us/' quitted Ireland in 1798. They now fo.rm a thriv­ing. settlement. They are well off, .free from debt,with good farms and quantities of .steck. It is looked on as one of the II108t thriving settlements in. the island."" Mr. Cunard, to whose enterprise the ptilitic owes the successful establishment of steam packets between Liverpool and Btllintx-thus doing more for the union of British North America and the mother country than the legislation of a century ha.d achieved-is the owner of 2,30,000 Acres in J>rinoe Edward Island., and of la.rge estates both in New Brunswick and Nov'.' Sc?tia. His evi?ence, though oautious, IS not the less satisJactory. "" I think,"" he observei,;, ""that t.h'e English fumers are the best. I think the Irish fitand 110xt if they come from the farming districts, and their children are very good. The Irish are very good to their friends ; no people in the world are more so. The Irish make good settlers after a time­Their descendants are aU good settlers.'' (705-743.) In Canada, Mr. Pemberton, a member of the Legislative and Executive Council, observes (876)-"" I do not make any dis­tinction between the emigrants from the different parts of the United Kingdom except in this-I find the Irish best adapted for all work re,;-~.1iring great stren""th, and so far I think them better calcuiated than anyothel.'. class for settling in a new country whenwithout the means of pur.chasing land."" Captain Rubidge, an intelligent naval offioor, concerned in emigration for 28 years in Upper Oa.nada, states that­"" Even in the worst situation the Irish pauperized emigrants are much improved in their condition ; th11y have everything here that is necessary for their support ; thefr land is become mol'e valuable ; their farms have increased ; they have a certain number of cows ; and are getting into better houses; Every family has been the means of brrnging out about five times the number to join them as volun­tary emigrants."" Let us now pass . to the case ofNew South wales :-"" There is a class of the Irish emigrants .that would be admirably adapted for the ruder labour of the colony. Very many of them; particularly the people of Connaught,would be admirs ably suited for the occupation of herds­men and shepherds. It is an occupation quite suited to the civilization of the people. The children who encumber the poor houses in Ireland might be intro­duced into the Australian colonies with very great advantage. I know that most valuable agricultural servants ha.ye been fonnd among th13 Irish."" Thisis the evi­dence of Colonel M'Ari;hur. Mr. Willis, late a judge in the colony of New .South Wales, expresses the following somewhat qualified opinion :-'' The Irish are good labourers if they are looked after, but they require some superintendence. Thel' require v .. ry close superintendence, and then they will work as well as any English­men."" A most striking case is described by Mr. Verner, a resident at Port Philip (3,844) :-"" An Irishman, named John­son, was my gardener ; he had not a six pemie when he came. When l last saw hiin he rented a farm (50 acres he had cle,i.redJ. He had a large crop of wheat, I think the whole 50 acres were unde1 cultivatioR. He had a teim of eight bnllocks, a horse t'> rid"", a good gard.en1 and 9ome few cpws. This is not a solitarn K instance.; I could name many others. 1 chiefly employed Irishmen ; I found them extremely useful ; I should say equally useful with any other men."" But perhaps the most interesting evi­dence, on the whole, is that of Mr. Chis­holme, whose. disinterested i.nd untiring .benevolence is gratefully recorded in the report of the Colonial Legislative Council, November, 1843. He informs us (4,071) :-""I did not find the slightest difficulty in dealing with the Irish settlers as compared with others. I found them extremely well-tempered. It latterly became a point with me to explain to two or three sensible Irishmen the line I in­tended to take. I endeavoured to .give them hope, and having succeeded in that I usedto let. them loose among the others. Confidence would spread without any more direct influence from me. If I had taken the English or Scotch first I should have found more difficulty."" I have thus conducted you from North Brunswick, through Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Upper and Lower Canada, and finally,.to New South Wales, and its most prosperous off-set, Port Philip. The evidence is all to the same effect, and there is much more on the minutes which I could have extracted in aid of my argu­ment. I think,Sir,thatyou will now admit that I.have referred you. to some evidence that i;hould induce you to reconsider a state­ment made in an article on colonization, written in other respects with consum­mate ability and truth. You speak of Irish emigrants as consisting, "" to a man, of the lower orders of Irish, carrying with them misery and degradation, a visionary temperament, and a factions religion ; a aeep sense of injury, and a burning hatred of the British name."" Believe me, Sir, you are mistaken. When their loyalty was tried'in Canada, no men were more to be relied on than the Irish. No sympathisers were to be found among them, and the extracts with which I have alread~ troubled you prove how rapidly they rise from poverty to wealth, to intel ligence, and to well merited political rank. I fully admit the sufferings of the present year and the wretchedness of too many of the emigrants. But you have most justly attributed this to "" our present system, or rather our want of system altogether."" You have shown both the power and the knowledge requi­site to grapple with this subject. entreat you to persevere, but to _do so with calmness and impartiality. Do not embitter or poison the springs in those newly-settled lands, or excite at the Anti'­podtis that war of races which has bee:µ tjle curse of our societyand the bar to our progress in Europe. You must not infer from these observa­tions that I am favourable either to the creation of a Nova Hibernia in our Colonies or an endowment of Romanism there. I think these suggestions great blots in the otherwise very able Memorial of Mr. Godley to Lord John Russell. Neither am lfor freeing the Irish land­lords from their duties and responsibilities by clearing their estates at the expense of the Treasury. No emigration from Ire~ land will be effectual to which these land­lords are not called very largely to,contri­bute. I wish to guard against these sup­positions, but I must not pursue the subject Remember, Sir, that every Irisll emigrant fixed in our colonies is an emi grant the less to Liverpool and Man~ chester. Remember that prosperous emi~ grants fixed in Australia become con­sumers of British produce to the value of from £6 to £7 per head, and ill. British North America to the value of £3 or £4. But remember, above all, that the passion of Ireland-a desire for land-becomes in the colony the reward and incitement to industry, while in Ireland it is the source of social disprganization, rapine, and murder. I am, Sir, your very obedient, humble servant, Oct. 9. AN IRISH .PROPRIETOR.","(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, THURSDA.Y, OCTOBER 14, 1847.)",3,10/14/1847
"(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1847.) Sir,:--You probably will b~ good enough to allow the following facts to appear in your journal, as it is but just that the true p0sition of the landed gentry of Ireland should be placed before the British public at this important crisis. An overwhelming population has grown i1p on their estates, in nine instances out of 10 in oppositioi_.to the attempts of the landlords to restram it. Two causes have created this state of things ;-first, the generation of landowners who lived 60 a.nd 80 vears ago let their farms in large tracts to persons who were then substan­tfal yeomen. They grazed these lands, but when corn reached an enormous price during the revolutionary war these yeomen subdividedthes_e farms ad injinifom; these second-class tenants again subdivided their lots, until the country in many places became cut up (like France) into farms or lots, no larger than pocket hand­kerchiefs, with a consequent increase of the population. The landlord had no power to prevent this system ; the head tenant had a lease, and ""could do as he liked with his own ; "" which he did with e; vengeance. An Irish farmer provides for his sons and daughters by giving them so many acres of his farm as marriage portions. This is their custom, and until the system can be prevented by time and irerseverance an estate cannot be placed in a healthy position. Where a lease stands against the landlord, h8 is power­l(!ss ; where it expires, he is called an exterminator ; if he endeavours even .to buy out the petty occupants and increase the size of the farms, he is resisted by all the chicane of the law, and probably shot into the bargain. So much as regards the middlemen, as they are termed. ' In the second place, the population has incr.eased prodigiously . from-another cause :-the priesthood reMive their. moneys from the dues .paid :them by the lower classes ; these dues - consist of fees payable at Ohristmas sl!ld. Elaster, on marriages, births, death11,. confessions, purgatorial payments, and many other Roman Catholic ceremonies. Consequently, it is the interest of the priesthood to encourage early marriages by every means in their power. Marriages in Ireland and subdivisions of land are synonymous. :Eletween the middleman with a lease, and the priest, the landlord is in aserious predicament ; he has avery difficult task tp perform, and one which requires daily attention and vigilance, coupled with ex­treme caution, or the rasults wiU be fatal: From t,hese two causes have arisen the fact, thatthere areatleast 1,000,000people in Ireland, whom no one knows what to d.o with or whither to send, or how to keep from starving, now that the potato has become degenerated. The three king~ :doms groan under the weight of the ex­~nses lately incurred ; it is almost an impossibility to counteract these evils, excltpt by a system of emigration on a large scale. Drainage and other improve nfents in agriculture will only be an adjunct'--the population can never be snP_1ported by these measures alone. The position of the great mass of tbe landowners of Ireland is this-over two­thirds of the country they are owed from a year and a half to two rears' rent. The farmers ha~-e reaped a plentiful harvest, which they . have well thatched in their. haggards, and will not sell it, intending to pay their landlords little or nothing~ There is a wide-spread combination or confederacy formed -from one end of the; country to the other (generally speaking) to defraud the landlord of his just rights, on the same plan of action which was resorted to in the anti-tithe war. The same opposition is carried on by the farmers against the payment of taxes for the county cess as well as the poor rates. The laws <of the land are defied by an armed population, who have become a drilled banditti. The lowest ruffians are armed, they plunder every one ad libi­tum, and there is no law to disarm them. The landlords have been disunitedfrom their tenants by the hourly exertions of the priesthood and the agitators, whose sole object in so doing is that they may; wield the masses at elections, and ret~m~ to Parliament those precious. specimens of legislators who are sent over to London' to represent Irish constituencies ;-that'. is the secretofthesystem_!ltic abu:Seof Irish;: l1>ndlords. Al'l'o; they are to be amfr -'. hilated, beca_11se the great majority of them are ..l'rotestants, attached to their; religion and th~ British connexion. They, are, in fact, th!¼ only: bar to the supremacy, of the Popish religi_on in Ireland. These priests never will be at rest. till they have established the Roman Catholic religion.in the ascendant. The Protestant religion and the union of England and Ireland stand or fall with the fate of the Protestant landlords. People in England cannot comprehend these things ; it requires a residence_ of years in lreland to understand this vit'al' subject in all its truth. A man must have dealings with these r eople to discover these facts, bnt not tiI he has trafficked with them for land can he possibly be made to credit that which is the actual and bona fide stateofthe case-heisnojudgetill then~ Of late years the collection qf the tithes has been thrown on the landlord ; be is now the tithe proctor and is oblig~d to get in the Prbtestant clergyman's rent­charge (as it is facetfously called) from a Roman Catholic population. Human art could not have devised a system better calculated to disunite landlord and tenant in Ireland. The tithe should have been converted into a land-tax, and placed under the'control of commissioners, and the clergy paid from the fund, similarly to the system oursued by the Board of K2 Ecclesiastical Commissioners, &c., who have the management of the affairs of abolished sees ..In the meantime the poor­rate, in its mitigated state, ""amounts to a tax of 20 per cent. generally. This pro­portion falls on the landlord at this very moment, besides other county charges for prev.ious relief rates; and, deprived by la.w­Iesir violence of his rents,he is forced to pay these taxes, and hooted if hedoes not give employment to the masses, though he has Mt a shilling to pay thei:n for their labour. .. The Government of the country now begin to understaRd the true state of things in Ireland ; they see that this universal system of "" repu,d:ia:tion "" amongst.theland ooo'upiers must be pµt down by the strong arm of the law, or the bonds of society will be uprooted, and chaos be the result. I understand that Qieasures to counteract this infamous confederacy will be immediately proposed to Parliament. There is not a man in li;eland who has anything to. lose, who <l!les not fully appreciate the manly de­termination which the Earl of Clarendon }Jas shown to sustain the rights ef pro­perty and the enforceme:rft of legal demands. But "" the law as it stands "" ,ii, inadequate to meet the emergency ; it h~ not power enough to.conquer'' passive of resistance "" combined with "" brute force."" Much land has remained uncultivated, especially in the west of Ireland. The landlord has no power to get into posses­sion of it and till it, the tenantry having leases ; they will neither surrender it nor cultivate it. A year must elapse before the law can give it to him,for every chicane will be resorted to,toprevent him. In fact,a summary statute must be passed on thia very important question. The truth is, the Government as well as the landlords are both counteracted by-the excess of knavery exhibited by the lower classes. ; they are demoralized to a degree un­paralleled in the history of the world. Having trespassed so much on your space, I must conclude by expressing an earnest hope that the landowners of Ire­land will not be dispirited,-that they will put their shoulders resolutely to the wheel, and work like men. I feel con­vinced that, by trusting to their own energie~ and to the mercy of l'rovidenoo, they will in the end conquer their diffi­culties .and regenerate their country, aided and assisted as they will be by those in England who value the,rights of pro­perty.

The manager had for some time been threatened. The tenants refused either to pay rent, to till the land, or to give it up. It was the plain duty of a proprietor to check a stalle of things fraught with misery and death to the still increasing, still impo, erished mass. .Accordingly Ma)or MAHON last year assisted many to emigrate, leaving the coast clearer for l;hoEe that remained. .At the expense of £6,000 he chartered two vessels and sent ob.t a number of his tenants to .America. Many more wished to be su favoured, hut the Major's means were exhausted for that yeaT. We are now told, however, that long before this he was "" a cloom&d man."" His name stood first on a list of twelve gentlemen proscribed by the Carbonai:i of Roscommon, for refusing to continue the , wasteful and degrading . oonacre system. The failure of the potat9 .crop saved them for a time. Last Tues­day. this gentlflman drove into. Strokfls­town, and called at his ag11nt's oflic11, to lay out exwnsive plans of improvement, havh1g just borrowfld mvnfly from the draining fund to employ sixty families for the winter. He proceeded to Ros­common, where, for want of funds, the poorhouse was in danger of being closed, and exerted himself there to keep open all the arrangements for the benefit of the poor. On his return from this chari­table duty he was murdered on his own estate, and there is every reason to be­lieve by his own people. A little after 6 o'clock in the evening two assassins.marked him as he passe-0. One of their pieces took effect, lodging a heavily loaded discharge ili' his breast, and killing him on the spot. The moral aspect of thts tragedy may not distinguish it from the vulgar crowd of assassinations. In some respects .he sacrifice of a large proprietor, necessarily bt-Qught into collision with poverty, numc hers, and discontent, is not so horrid and unnatural an offence as the treacherous laughter of a neighbour clwellingtiecurely in the midst of his murderers. By us, . however, and by all who on this-side the Channel have feH it their duty to inculcate with a. timely vehemence the duties .of property, this fearful catas­trophe will be felt as a great blow and­discouragement to the cause of lri1dr J:Q. generation. We lmow that no argument, no appeals to conscience or to shame, no penaltie11, no boons, will countervail against the hideous thought, that the Irish proprietor who sets to work to rescue his land from barrenness, and his tenantry from barbarism, may carry his sentence on his brow, and be for years-"" a doomed man.""

"LANDLORD MURDERS. (SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1847.) (FRO}f THE TIMES' CORRESPONDENT.) DUBLIN, Nov. 4. An incident took place yesterday in the ,office of Mr. Murphy (one of the Masters Chancery) which strongly illustrates the disastrous effects of the utter inse­c'urity of life and property in this coun­try. A fee simple estate, consisting of .288 acres of prime feeding fond, with an excellent dweiling-house, advantageously situated, in the county of Roscommon, ""Was put up for sale at £10,000 for the 'first bid, being scarce one-half of the esti­ntated value of the property. While the lsale was proceeding, a gentleman got up, 'and addressing those about him, spoke of the d,ingerous neighbourhood in which the estate lay, remarking that it wii,s close to the spot where only the night previous Major Mahon fell by the bullet of the assassin. The announcement created a powerful sensation in the office, and a chilling silence d a minute or two succeeded. The Master at length inter­posed, and having severely reprimanded the speaker for his intrusive observations, ordered the sale to proceeq. But it was to no purpose. The blow had struck home ; and after an offer of £2,500, or something like four years' purchase, the sale was indefinitely postponed. EMIGRATION AS A ~EMEDY FOR IRISH POVERTY.",LANDLORD MURDERS.,1,11/6/1847
"(LETTER TO THE EDITOR, ,VEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1847.) Sir,-In a former letter, which you did me the favour to insert, I endeavoured to ivindit:ate, on the authority of colonial evidence of the. highest respectability, [the characters of the Irish emigrants. !Unless that evidence is to be set at nought, I flatter myself I demonstrated that the Irish, when removed from the ,unhappy influences which affect them at 'home, are thrifty, industrious, and .orderly, and are readily accepted bythose colonie3 where labour is in demand. I .'.was rejoiced to see., from your commen­,tary on my letter, that we did not differ ;so essentially as I hadat first apprehended. Will you permit me now to bring under your observation the statistics of a single townland, which seems to me to prove how utterly impossible it is, in certain parts of Ireland, that the present problem can be solved, unless emigration be re­stored to 1 I say "" in cert:J,in parts. of Ireland"" advisedly, for I am far fr0m affirming that emigration is universally required ; but where this safety-valve does not exist the consequences are not only to create misery in one spot, but to extend discontent and disorder into neigh­bouring districts, though they may be more bappily circumstanced. The townland in question is situated in a southern county. No complaint can be made of the want of security of tenure, from the absence of a lease, nor of suffer­ing produced by the exactions of the landlord ; on the contrary. The town­land consists of 125 statute acres, and is. valued to the i;oor's-rate at £125. It was let in 1781 for three lives, two of which are still in being, for a rent of £10 Irish currency. lt was let as a single tenement to one tenant. On this ]'and there exist at present 43 houses, containing upwards of 50 families and i77 human beings; Of these 277, above 100 dccpuy less than aspace of 12 statute acres. Five families are without one square foot of land ; three hold but 20 perches, or I-16th of an acre, each ; three hold but one roo.d, and six but half an acre. Your intelligence will at once show you that it is utterly impossible for this multitude of paupers t6 subsist where they are now placed. Even before ""Ireland's woes began,"" even if a poet could have dreamt that a rood of ground could have sustained '' a man,"" it would be impossible for Gold­smith himself to suggest that 20 perches, or half a rood, could have maintained families of 8 and 10 persons, which must be the case if this townland is to be left as it is at present. The proprietor only receives £10 rent, or less than I-12th of the valued rental. The middle­man or mesne lessee is almost as great a pauper as the most wretched of his tenants ; 27 out of the 43 houses con­tain b11t one single room, occupied in some cases by two families, consisting of six, seven, and eight individuals, of all ages. Let me ask you how can this land be made to raise an adequate supply of food so long as it is thus occupied 1 The Tipperary meeting could hardly contem­plate a nearer approach to fixity of tenure than has existed for 66 years, or a more moderate rent. Yet the condition of things which I have described exists, and is an absolute bar to all amelioration. No e:x:penditure of capital, no application of skill and science, would meet the case, whilst this excess of population exists. Rothschild and Lord Ashburton, Liebig and Mr. Coke, would be alike at fault. Nor let it be said that if proper cove­nants had been introduced into the ori­ginal lease this misery might have been averted. There is 110 one familiar with the state of Ireland who does not know that such covenants; where introduced, were openly violated, and that such vio­lations were sanctioned by the subtleties of the law. The receipt of rent was held a waiver of the covenant, however clear and distiµct might be its import. And when; in later times, the Imperial Par­liament endeavoured to prevent the con­tracts entered into between landlord and tenant from beirigdefeated, ""scared at the sound itself had made,"" it repealed the Act against subbtting soon after its enact­ment.. In a case like this the proprietor is powerless. If he buys out the miildle­man he renders himself subject to aHin­cumbrances the tenant may have thrown on the lan<l,-to all the contracts which may have been made by him, either legal or equitable,to all outstanding judgments, to all m1exrnuted decrees. He involves himself in a labyrinth whence there is no extrication. Comparethe .state of one ofthesepaupers with the following account of the con­dition of an Irish free emigrant settled at New Richmond, iu New South Wales. I transcribe the words cf an original letter now before me :­ "" When first I set up farming I had no means of cultivating the Jand but by the. strength of our arms. I ran credit £20 for seed and provisions, which took two years to pay. When I got myself out of debt I built a house and fenced the farm, and now, thank God, I have 25 acres of wheat, and 26 head of horned cattle, to­gether with three head of horses and a quantity of pigs. We have four bullocks, a plough and harrow. We grow and cul tivate our own tobacco."" I shall only add one extract more. 'It is taken from a letter dated Wallongong, and is written by a free emigrant who had not even the means to reach the port of embarcation without charitable help :---;­ "" Dear Brother,-I mean to let you know how I am going on. I am living on a piece of ground which we call a clearing lease. You clear as much as you can for the term of seven years, rent free, with a run for cattle ~1ttached to it. We have five acres of wheat, three acres of potatoes, seven acres of maize, together with pumpkins, melons, cucumbers, and vegetables of every description which is useful for pigs. I live here more com­fortable than --and--at home. I live rent free, and they cannot ; and my diet generallv is bread, butter; tea , and the best of beef and pork-ten times a day if I have a mind to eat it. I have nothing to buy but beef, tea, and sugar. When I go to Sydney with my crops _I . buy half a chest of tea and four b+i,gs of sugar."" ' Compare this statement with th~ condi­tion of the inhabitants of the over-peopled townland I first described. Remember, too, that in the one case the Irish!Ilan builds houses, in the other he burns them.; in Irehnd he cuts down 1andlords' agents _and police, in the other he cuts down wheat and maize. The only 'blood he sheds at Sydney is that ~f fat .catt1e ancl pigs. Remember that in 6rie case he adds to the capital of his neighbours, in tho other that he destroys it. Remember, moreover, that in Sydney he const1me11 '.British manufactures to the value of £7 per head, whereas the experience of last year shows the expenditure of millions of :public money as being required for supp0rt­mg all this wretchedness at home.

They will put themselves into tl1e position, and, indeed, tho actual condition of savages, by theh greedy appetite fol' blood, Tbey will neglect and actually thwart the most benevolent, energetic, and ~reat-minded e.fforts to improve tl1em. It 1s due to the memory of our for<tfathers to record the obstructions they have l1ad to encouuter in the labours of frelu.nd. It may be due to our own memory in turn. The present Viceroy of InELAND enjoys n European reputation. He is known to be a man of justict1 nnd peace, and one who will never for a moment bA led awny by _I1assion from the calm contemplation and steady pursuit of what is be~t for all parties. No one will aceuse him of siding with a faction, or exaggerating the sins of one class by forgetting those of another. Such we believe to have been the general character of those whom successive .Ad­ministrations have selected for this arduons post. But Lord CLAilE..""fDON is known to be such ne we have described. Yet even he is obliged to exhibit the sternest side of llis character in an admonitory proclamation. He is driven to con­form to the snd precedents of office ; .. to denounce outrage, to threaten an indirect and indisotirnimtte vengeance on the die.­tricts disgl'nced by c1 ime, to wnrn acces­sories, abeLtorH, and protectors, and to di.JJguise the rea.l gentleness of I.is spirit in the stern phraseology of official rebuke. Nor will the example be lost on this country. Vfo believe it to be one prinai­pal element of difliculty in the Jrish ques­tion, that in this empire two races are necessarily united under the same political sentiments antl constitutional maxims, who are in fact by no means oqunlly r,re­pa.red for their nctual applicittion. The strong measures 11ecessary for Ireland are revoltiug to the feeling of this com1try. Ireland, meanwhile, is ever arguing on the hnsis of British liberty, all the time that she is cla.iming a licence absolutely inconsistent with ~liberty or nny other principle of order. Like n mam>ctis sujet in good sociAty, Ireland asks at tho same. time the ple,isures of self-will ancl tho re­wards of seH-control. The public opinion of this islsnd, howeve1 , is fast becoming aliYe to the truth that a different mt>o.sure is neces~ary for the loyal and orderly on the one hnnd, and the lawless, seditious, mischievous, and irreconc1lahle on the other, An evident organization against property and life, tolerated and excused by the spiritual leaders of the disaffected, is an incident wh-ich calls for something more than mild expression, flattering titles, affectionate familiarity, and confi­ dential disc)ll!Blon.

A further letter corrobora.tin.ir field of employment, <and. it Js equaµ.j olear th~t this can only be effected by the introduction of capital. Let us see, then, what is the effect of gratuitous relief on capital already employed, 01 that been recently. attemptod to be intro­duced with a view to profitable investment. Valentia, from which place your cor­respondent dates his letter, there has b(ell long in work an extensive sla.te quarry manufactory, employing at times many as 1,200 men. 1 h we before me letter from the manager and principal shareholder in that work, to the effect &hat, long as gratuitous work is distributed, cannot procure labour at the same price as heretofore, and, consequently, those works must be contmcted. Again, Dingle, which is the J>rincipal fish­t.own on that coast, there are about small boats of one sort and an­other, with from six to eight men de­pending for subsistence on the working each boat. In the first week of Sep­tember I spent three days at Dingle-the first two days were lllim:my and tho boats not go out, the third day was a.El fine day for fishing as any in the year, and mackerel and pilchards wore reported, vessels that had seen the shoals in ~n.d about the bay, to be very abundant. my great surprise I observed that ­more than 12 boats had ione out that morning, and on invostigutmg the cause found it to pe strictly and solely tho following :--Bemg Saturday, a double allowance of soup was to be distributed ; there was also an expectation of a gratui­tous di~tribution of meal _; 1m,d it bein~ a regulation that the apphcat1on for tno soup and meal should be made in pel'.Son, day's fishing was thus sacrificed. The experiment, of which Mr. Benett the manager, has excited considerable foterest and expectation in that part of the country, but its principal result hitherto has been to show tho im:r,ractica­bility of introducing foreign capital with any prospect of adequate return1 so long the labour has to compote with idle­ness, though that idleness be Gssociated with the barest subsistonce1or even. a chance of subsistence. Such is the dispo­sition of the IriAh to depend on charity !-and gifts, that no amount devoted to -auoh purposes could satisfy all ; where ~ne is satisfied, io --are' disappointed, (:U:d no o?-e can wit7!eS11 ~h-'e r,e~k_,ree_ss._n____e_s s f1V1th which the Ir1$h m the south-1;western districts wHI cast, to the winds cerf.ainty to be obtained b;y' Iiibou,r, the merest chauoe of the barest 1111bsistence to be obtained_ by begging, without feeling that the charity which has been so lavisllly conhibuted to save life, indirectly by its inevitable in­adequa{,y to meet all expectations, has been the means of destroying life, Many well-informed persons belie,,e that fewer lives would have been sacri­ficed if not one penny had been given gratuitously. However that may be, the moral mischief that has been done to the survivors seems to admit of but two re­medies ; tl1e one is to Jet starvation take its course until such as are capable of being instructed shall take warning, and recover their reason sufficiently to see that their only hope of life is in finding work ; tho other is to employ what re­mains of the charitable funds in providing such work as shall produce, in the most direct manner, food ancl subsistence, at the same time that it will aid in teaohing them the salutary lesson, that life de­pends upon h\bour, There is, doubtless, much more difficulty in administering a funcl in this way than in gratuitous relief ; but surely this ought not to be an impediment; Would it not be well worth while to devote a portion of the funcl to rayment for such additional care and attention, than that the whole fund should not only be saorifioed ancl lost, but might become the means, though remotely, of sacrifioing more of life and happiness than it immediately eaves 1 'l'hore is no laok of precedents to justify tho British Association in setting apart a portion of their funcls for reproductive purposes, suoh as fishing. In 1786, a so01ety, called the British Society, raised £40,000 for _the improvement of tho fisheries of Scotland, and the result of their operotions may bf' seon in the now flourishing town of Tobormory and other towns and villages established by them, Morerecentlyafilnd wassetapart, under the name of tho Reproductive Loan Fund, from _a charitable subscrip­tion like the present, and it is by a sum of £6,000 advanced to the Government out .of that iund that the curing stations wore established on the west coast of Ire­land at, the end-of last year. And it appea1 s tbat the Highlanrl Relief Oom­mittee have alresdy aqopted a similar course by npplying what remains of their fu;nd 1 I believe_ about £30,000, to the extension of the fisheries. The manogers of that fund allowed no imaginary difficulties to stand in the way of tlus obviously wise and beneficent plan, and determined at once to obtain an aot of Parliament to sanction such an appropri­ation, if, on further consideration, it should appear inconsistent with the ob­jects of the donors. 13ut can it for one moment be supposed that any oontriliutor _to such 11, fund would object to the tn1stees availing themselves of the experience of the last year in the appropriation of such portion of the fund as remains in hand '/ Strictly speaking, the fund was subscribed for the r,otato failure of 1846-71and the Comrtnttee, as it appears to me, would lmve been perfectly justified in closing their accounts ut the e'nd of that period and reporting to their sub­scribers the balance in h!I.Ild. In reser­ving this bal11nce for the exigencies of the forthcoming winter, they are olearly taking upon themselves an au­thority which was not permitted to them by the subscribers. The appeal to the public was for the "" relief of extreme_ distreRs in remote districts"" then pre­vailing ; is it not quite reasonable to assume that many of the subscribers would positively dbjeot to the extension of this relief to another se11Son, the cir­cumstances and causes of the distress being in the meantime completely changed YMay not the diminished sub­scri~tion1 under the Queen's letter, be attributed, inpart at least, to a considera­tion that it was no longer expedient to euppnrt the people of Irela.nd by gratui­tous relief¥ Surely, Sir, sufficient has been done to uphold the character of this country for charity and generosity quite unparalleled -may we not now be permitted to take a more deliberate and calculating view as to what may be the best mode of prevent­ing such calamities for the future t What eecudty have we that the pota.toes will be planted next year 1 How are people who are to be fed gratuitously this winter to be convinced of the necessity for their re­lying on their own exerLions for the next! The present distribution is no longer a sudden and overwhelming visitation, under which both donors and reoipients are panic-stricken and indisposed to reason and calculate._ The people do reason, and their reas')ning brmga them, as I know from aotual observation, to this conclusion-that the. English are bound to keep them alive, come what may. :r'hey consider it but part. payment of the great debt due from the Saxons ; when the £30,000,000-its present amount-­shall ~ave been fully paid, they have un­doubtmg confidenoe m the ingenuity ol Mr. O'Connell ; and their priests show that we are still indefinitely in their debt lt is not for nothing that Repeal and priestoraft have been so liberally sup, ported during the present crisis without the in<l:efatigable exertions and ingenuity of their leaders, the people must haye felt the degradation,-"" the coals of fire"" of Saxon bounty in rotu1 n for Celtic abuse ; and though we may smile at the rn.Yings of the lion of the fold of Judah and the weak Jesuitism of l\'Cr Jobn O'Connell, we should also reflect that our indiscriminate bounty is receh-ed with their commento.ry upon it, and is made to corroborate their argnruenta as to the 0 1,.. ligations of the Saxon to the Celt. I cannot close these .remarks without bearing my humble but disinterested testimony to the manner in which the Committee of the British .Association have hitherto performed the duties they undertook. The zeal and ability and promptitude with which they l1avo dis­charged their trust, are as honourable to tbem individually as the fund itself is to the nation which they represem. It is with the utmost respe-ct and con­:fidenoe in that Committee that I have thus ventured to suggest to tbem,through your colu10ns, that facls bavo now been elicited, that e:s:perience has been bought, which not only JUstif;v, but demand from them, a reconsideration of the best mode of applying w-ha.t remains of their fund. There is, by all reports, enough, if e.p plied, aa similar funrl11 have been, to some reproductive pu~se, .such as fishing, to convert all the d1Sasters which have oc­uurred into a p0rmanent boon to Irelaiid. If, on the other hand, the gratuitous system is continued, neither that, nor any other conceivable amount of money, will be sufficient to save the lives which have been thrown npon it, or to conci~ liate the affections ofthe people ; but, on the contrary, it will aggravate every evil by which Ireland is afflicted. Wherever this charity extends;commercial capital ia driven away i whenever iHalls short, dis content and aestitution will be inoreas~d. 1 am, Sir, your very obediallt ser:van~:_ A.,B","(LETTEll. !rO THE EDITOR, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 131 1847.)",1,11/13/1847

"THE NEED OF COMMON SENS~ (LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, DECEMBl!R 9, 1847,) Oh for just a little common sense in our poor Irish kinsmen I We do not ask the powerful intellect of ARISTOTLE, the mother wit otSooRATES, We have wish to see them all at once a nation ADAM S!IIITHS or PALEYS, The smallest modicum of that st,erling commodity hich forms the chief stooli: in trade of every village! and almost every_ family in England, wi I be a wonderful improve­ment. were the Irish-of course we take them as a whole, and particularly as they are represented by their leaders-only as wise as an average English and Scotch farmer, or shopkeeper, or labourer, we shonld shortly find them quite another nation, The .Aot of Union was confessedly incomplete without this1 for the first. con­dition ought to. have been that Ireland shoultl l1ave a Ehare in the joint stook of British sagac.ity. Therl! should have been free trade dn prudence-as well as pigs, and while England opened her ports black cattle, Ireland should have re­moved the prohibition on practical wisdom, The person who first invents common sense in Ireland, and brings it into general use, will rank above the greatest discoverers. We would rather teach the people there ten maxims of good management than showthem ten hundred newplanets. TheO'OONNELLS,afterall,are right in saying that we have done nothing for the country. We gave or lent them last winter £10,000,000, but we did not give them, for we could not give them, one sixpen'orth of sense. Here the Irish members, they wbo particularly profess to represent Ireland, and enjoy the confidence of the country, are . using their great opportunity to send the Irish on as mere a wild goose chase as ever wasimposed on the greenest April fool. The poor Irish peasant is about destitute of capital a11 the peasants of most other countries ; but be possesses good wind and limbs, lias some stock of ingenuity, and a. warm heart in his bosom, rhat poor fellow's onl,v chance to b., urged to depend on himself, to set steadily to work, to make bis own fortune, or follow it should it happen to present itself, But what is the O'CONNELL receipt for makina him a man 7 He must baok 47 years, and rip up the Act of Union ; he must pine for the golden age which commenced in the repeal of PoYNINo's Act, and ended in the great Irish rebellion ; he must extract .oracles of independence from PLUNKETT and SAuruN, Lord 0LARE, Lord 0..1.STLEREAGII, and Mr. PITT ; he must re-open the apportionment of our national debt, esti­mate comparative percentages of increase, and declare a balance of £60,000,000, or, while he is about it, £600,000,000 due from England to Ireland ; he must set down to the credit of Ireland all the war taxes which England. has remitted from her own shoulders, and had never im­posed on Ireland at all ; he must compute the oorn and cattle whioh his father and his grandfather sold to England for his rent ; in a word, he must keep op1:n and before him some five hundred debtor and creditor accounts between. the Saxon and the Oelt, and make a point of doing nothing till every score of the. five. hundred is settled to his mind, The fivll hundred bills of right are to have a daily hearing, and no peasant must lie down m his hut till he has pronounced judgment in his own favour. No change of conditions or distance of time is to bar the. recovery of his claims. NuUum temp1is Oeltioo occur, it, Every peusant must have a horse gratis, because a hundred years since, by a then obsolete Act,a Roman Oatbolicgent!eman might conceivably be dismounted, We have not alluded to a tenth or a hundredth of the mare's nests which the poor Oelt is duped by his guides dl\y by day into finding, It would take a history of the world to retrace them. They begin with the deluge. The young O'CoNNELLS indeed are beginning to be rather shy of very remote and dubious antiquity, The Rouse of Commons is too matter of £not an assembly for this mythical lore, Sir R-OBER'l:, who would find. no difficulty in reducing HANNIBAL to £ s; d., would soon tell yon tlte valU:e of. 600 a.ncienf Kings of Ireland in a. convertible cur­rency. Mr, FEARGUS O'CONNOR, however, supplies the omission, and we have no doubt tbat in doing so fills a real ga}J in thll Irish understanding. Under his judicious auspices poor Pat has to travel rather far. He is to learn, in order to reject, the Oharter of EnoAR, and to analyze the bull of Pope ADRIAN to HENRY Il, He is to criticise the rights. of STRONGBOW and the demeanour of Prince JOHN at the mature age of twelve. He is to bore through fifty strata of borough corruption, through the rich alluvial of PITT to the gravel of King JAMES I. He is to learn the table of political priceR, from the days of the GERALDINES to the creation of the Union Peers. He is to solace his leisure hours with recollections of CROMWELL, and calm his perturbed spirits with the victories of King WILLIAM. He is to number the Irish missionaries of the seventh century, and its learned doctors of the ninth. He is to read his story in every tale of con­quest, and his wrongs in every act of oppression. He is to confine his know­ledge to that which no longer exists, and his ambition to that which cannot return. His hopes are to be in the ruined castle, and his affections in the grave. Whereas the instinct of ambition is strong in all men, and the law of pro~ress is compelled on human affairs, th9 Irishman alone is to be always looking back to what time and Heaven are taking away. He is to be tempted backwards in the race by the bitter apples of revenge. Heis taught to retrieve the past by retaliating forgotten injuries and reviving dead feuds. Back­wards, backwards-downwards, down­wards-deepei: and yet deeper into the mire and the clay ! is the cry of his blind guides. He hears the treacherous ai;ipeal to his weakness, his indolence, and his passions, and exhibits a consequent degradation and misery unparalleled in Europe, unaccountable in the children of SHEM. Now look to this island. How do we get on 1 Not that the Saxon is so full of Irish beef as a certain Archdeacon repre­sents. The great maj0rity of the Saxon race know as little of this luxury as the Celt. But they are industrious, content, dutiful, and happy ;-at least as happy as may be in this world. But what, we ask again, is the secret of British success 1 Looking forwards. There are but few men in this country, we had almost said in any class of life, who have not been wronged and injured-we might say, ruined-and all but annihilated over and over again, they and their fathers before I them. Time after time we have begun life again, and rejoiced in a fresh start, Who cannot remember, if not in his own history, at ltiast in that of his family, the greatest vicissitudes ? We could point to men who twenty years ago swept shops and slept under counters, who were cast on the world orphans or homeless, or who, after a youth of toil, were stripped of their all by dishonest partners or needy friends, who were ruined by commercial crises and financial uncertainties, who might have sat down and wept themselves to death at the very sight of the misery around them, but who speedily wiped the tears from their eyes and smoothed the wrinkle f.om their brow, who found hope at the bottom of their empty wallets, and set to work as if the world wits before tbem, who have thus won from the future a revenge on the past, and remember what they have gone through only as a foil to their present prosperity. Such i1 the case,not merely in the classes in which fortunes are lost and won, but even still more so the great industrial staple of the British population. Ninetetin labourers, or artisans, about, of every twenty, could tell, if they chose, how they were buffeted in youth, how they were starv~d at home, slaved by their first masters, insulted, turned off, cast adrift, wanderers on the face of the earth. They could tell of cottages from which they were ousted,' and commons of which they were de. frauded ; how often they had to begin the world afresh, how often they were penniless and friendless. But they did not turn rebels and murderers. They did not even sit down to make a catalogue of their wrongs. They forgave what the7 could, and forgot the rest. They buried their grievances, and so put them .out of sight. They looked before them for em­ ployment, and above themfor aid. So they set to work and built their nests again. Such is the story of that Saxon whom we, are accustomed to hear so much beholden to fortune, to position, and successful ascendency. The secret of his success is in himself, as it is in every. one who chooses to look forwards instead of sitting down to brood upon the past, THE IRISH PARTY lN PARLIAMENT.",THE NEED OF COMMON SENS~,2,12/9/1847
"(LEADING ARTICLE, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1847’.) The residuum of the O'CONNELL party in the House is not a very formid:1.ble mfair. Possessing .neither numbers nor weight, and telling neither in doors nor qut, it is compelled to adapt its opera­tions to its diminished resources, and no ~~r agitates but obstructs. lt ex­hibits rather the doting obstinacy of .an lJCtogenarian litigant than the freshness and vigour of which patriots are made. .for our own part, we derive but a verylf!ixed satisfaction from so lamentable a decay. '.rhere ought to be an Irish partyin the House-we will not say as a stand­,qig condition of our political arrange­~nts, .but at least .in .existing circum­~pces. That party ought to be strong in numbers, in unity, and in mod&ration. Whatever may be urged as to . every JP£1mher representing not merely one l;ltn-ough or county, one interest or class, ii; is impossible but that men. should. ~vocate with more spirit, information, 11,t1defrect, the interests with which theyii,re . .personally acquainted. Whatever the conceivable hazard to the balance of English. party' we should .rejoice to see t}i,e whole Irish representation united as 008 man m the furtherance of just, sound, ,and.practical measures for the irnprove­numt of their country. We have never umintained that the -deeply involved, and .inveterately disordered interests of Ire­land could safely be left to an English Freniier, Parliament, or people, and that llhe .representatives of the former had GQthing to do but to waif; and agree. ~hey might wait long enough, and agree flo their damage. But we have main­tained, and do maintain, that the repre­ae,itatives and people of England are en­titled, both in wisdom and in equity, to a.very great deference at the hands of &eland, and should be allowed a great lhlgative authority in Irish affairs, We kJJQw the path of fortune and the rule of right. Our customs .and institmtions are the envy not only of other countries, but of Ireland itself. The very jealousy which Ireland betrays at our greater success is a,n argument why she should give us credit for being able to advise her, and why she should respect our opinion in questions of social improve­ment.-The data of legislation, however, the facts of the case, and also the sug­ gestions, may well be expected to pn'Ceed from the Irish representatives. There exi~t, then, the occasion and the opportunities for a good Irish partv, whi.ch shall really be at the head of Irish progre.ss, and command the entire sym­pathy and respect of the whole British people. ._ If no such par.ty is in being, if what party there is drags on a precarious an~ attenuated existen~, and ispositirnly odious and contemphble to the publfo opinion of this island, that is not !-he fau1t of England or the fault of opFor­tunity. It is the fault of that party 11'.hich has l513~_!111d degraded itself by con­tmual exlnb1t1ons of rashness and vio­lence, of passion and caprice, and sym­pathy with crime., and antipathy to order and ri~ht. . But jt is not only the mora.l effe~t of these exhibitions, and the im­pressio.ns they leave on the feelings of the public. There is also a sound arg,umen­ . tative conclusion iu the matter. The people of England see not merely with horror and disgust, but with a sober­apprehension of danger,. th!J,t the leaders of Irish opinion, and the selected cham­pions of the popular hierarchy, throw the veil over cdme and ask licence for out­rage. They see that the mercies of this party are reserved for the assassin, and its severity for the victim. _No sooner does a landlor:l or a pg;rson bite the dust of the .highway than immediately a rigorous inquisition is held over his life and deserts. MrNoss-and RH.ADAMANTHUS sit in St. Stephen's and scrutinize his words and his deeds. With .these iron judges a life of patriotic intentions and laborious service is of no avail. Tho agrarian code guides the decision. It is true that the unfortunate deceased spent thousands in employmentandemigration ; it is true that he .brought mountains under the plDugh,. and doubled or tripled tho pro!luce .of the land he inherit-ed from his fathers ; but he displaced the intruder and the drone, who would neither pay rent, nor till his land, nor give it up to those who would, The occasion is duly amplified by the ex parte statements of his murderers and their frien<ls. So his doom is prononnced. Mrnos and RHADA­MANTHUS declare his life justly forfeited, his memory attainted, and his butchers acauitted. Such are the verdicts which are nightly heard with just indignation in the British House of Commons. Eng­land abhors the bloody tribunal, and leaves CATILINE and CETHEGUS in a minority which counts scarcely one to twenty honest men. England, as Mr. M. O'CONNELL says, without intending to eulogize, feels a sin­cereand substantial sympathy with distress and oppression in every part of the world. She ransomed the .African. Twice within our age she has spent her treasures and her blood for the deliverance of the Spanish Peninsula. She maintains a wordy but generous protest in behalf of the Pole. On her own soil poverty has the first lien on the land. The pauper is mainhtined though the landlord takes nothing. Mr. M. O'CONNELL taunts England with a compassion andgenerosity from the benefit of which Ireland alone is excluded. Does not England feel for Irebnd ? What mean the £10,000,000 ? Wlut mean tho £700,000 raised byprivate hands 7 Was it from any sordid feeling for the rights of property that all England combined to thmst a good Poor Law on the Irish proprietor ? We declare our belief that in all history, and in all the world, there is no public fact that so touches and afflicts the Englishman as the melancholy condition of his Irish fellow­subjects. England would undergo any labour or cost, and a.Imost any risk, to rescue Ireland from its slough of despond. Once show the way and prove the sound­ness of the plan, and England will see it fully tried, We may confidently appeal to what we ourselves have done for Ire­land. We have risked the goodwill of the whole English aristocracy by the zeal and perseverance with which we urged the duties of property. We lab:mred that the absentee should be a byword and a reproach, a very outcast from English society. We risked our credit for truth by retailing with strong comments Irish narratives of ejectments and clearance, extermination and death. We were ready to support the Ministers in any measures required for the famine, however arduous and costly. Nay, to go further back, the O'CoN'NELLS may know by domestic tradition that while we kept no terms with Repeal, or with the Liberator him­ self, so long as he was marshalling mil­lions on the old battlefields of the Saxon and Celt, we n,:ivertheless always received from his hands, with favour and indul­gence, any project whatever that intended the substantial good, not the.further.divi­sion and exasperation of the people. Then what now makes the gap 7 Why do the O'CoNNELLS look round and see the ancients of the Liberal cause, men not given te change, the representativ(;ls of large, popular constituencies, men whose pulse beats with the pulse of the people­all gravely resolved to establish first of all the reign of law and order 1 Whv do a host of great men whose lives, whose goodness and integrity are before all the world, express the gravest reprobation of the course which the Irish party thinks fit to adopt 1 These real patriots see that there is 110 hope whatever for Ireland till its long-standing issue of blood shall be stanched, In vain shall the landlord be goaded to his duties, when the slugs of the assassin threaten bis path. Capital is a sensitive thing, for it deposits many hostages wherever it settles. It shrinks instinctively from the soil on which dis­putes are settled with the rifle, where combination is familiar with the price of blood, and where as soon as speculation, after long and tedious promise, is matur ing its fruit, outrage stalks in and flings the crop to the ground. Nor can we hope to see the reign of terror at an end so long as the flame is openly or in­sidiously f~nned from the altar, orthe plat form, or the walls of Parliament itself. Were the owners of £10,000,000 on the point of carryingtheirwealthinto Ireland, to buy estates, to drain bogs, to build factories, one such speech as LAFFAN's, and one such incident as the slaughter of Major MAHON would scare away the whole timid tribe, Long and bitter ex­perience has taught the Liberals and the democracy of England, sorely against their will, that no plans of emancipation or liberation whatever, no screw applied to. the landowner, no extrication from the toils of the law, no levelling of religions or assimilation of races, will be more than ""a mockery, a delusion, and a snare,"" until the blunderbuss is rustzd and broken, until the Celt learns from the Saxon his horror of blood, until priests become meek , and agitator!! cautious,until the population acquires either goodness enough, or wisdom enough, or courage enough, to refuse all sympathy to the assassin. Is there personal feeling, or is therehoa, tile nationality between Great Britain and Ireland ? On the contrary, nothing is heard or read with more pleaRure in this country that any testimony to the general merits of Irish classes or indivi duals. The House of Commons has re, cently rejoiced to be informed, on goolf L authority, that the Roman Catholic ,bis}jops and clergy of that country have 'rendered great assistance to the officers of the Government in the difficult admi­nistration of the late relief measures. The IHouse of Commons does not believe that 1all the counties of Ireland are as Ros-common or Tipperary, that all the arch­bishops are M'HALES, all her bishops O'Hwarns's, and all her priests, de­!nouncers. Last night supplied an instance of British generosity and candour which should prove to the Irish how little pre­judice has to do with our measures. Dr. ,RYAN, the Roman Catholic Bishop at Limerick, hi the course of a charge delivered some weeks since, took a review :of all classes, and reproved them in turn. With a very intelligible and excusablo, though somewhat improper, generality, '.be said, unreservedly of all the higher 'cla~ses, that they "" were forgetful of their Christian obligations-they treated the poor like cattle-they were cold and callous to the voice of humanity, dead to all feelings of compassion, untouched by the cries of famine, the wailings of hunger, the lamentations of women and children, and the terrible condition of the poor man ; they exercised over their victims a system of heartless cruelty, calculated to bring down vengeance from Heaven upon them."" No sooner, how,. ever, had this been cited againsthisLord­ship, than the chivalry of the House was stirred up to give the interpretation all the benefit of the context and uf the writer's known virtues. One after another, half-a-dozen members connected with Ireland rose up to defend Dr. RYAN from the construction which it was natural to put on those words. If men will only live and preach as Dr. RYAN is said to do, they will not find their fair names hanging on this or thatexaggerated expression. England is able to appreciate a tenor of excellence, and to do justioe to it on a public appeal.","(LEADING ARTICLE, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1847’",2,12/11/1847
"AGRICULTURE IN IRELAND. (LEADING .ARTICLE, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1847.) The practical instructors in agriculture who, at the suggestion of Lord CLARENDON were recently appointed to traverse cer­tain districts of Ireland have already commenced their task. We publish to-day letter from a gentleman who. has every means of acquainting himself with the result of these operations, and, as far as his report goes, it is good. There has been, no doubt, a good deal of burly con­tempt displayed in certain districts for these emissaries of civilization. PLuTus was looked for, and TRIPTOLEMUS is ill­received. We have often thought it a pity that for their own sakes Irishmen could not be deluded like the old man's irons in . the. fable. The story goes that a certain man, a landed proprietor, was blessed with a fine family of sons. His estate was so large that it sufficed for the wants of the family during his children's.infancy that but a slender portion of it should be taken into cultivation.. What was enough for one family, however, was not enough for twelve. The old man got uneasy about the future fate of his sons. They were good~humoured; idle, Jolly fellows-more constant attendants at wakes and merry­makings than at the plough's tail. If any one of them ever gave the future a thought, it was but to repose on the con­viction that Fortune would stand his friend. One idea, sfogul'ar1y enough, was common to them all-that when matters came to the worst, and the black ox had put his hoof upon the foot of any one of them, he would be relieved from his difficulties by the discovery of a pot of' gold; Upon this hint the old man on his death-bed acted. The fable is too well known for us to transcribe it at length. The dying father told the young men who surrounded his bed-side, that with his own hands lie had dug a hole in a particular spot on the estate, and had (depo,!lited in ita pot containing the whole:or hfs personal )?roperty converted into bullion for the occasion. That which reason could not accomplish was effected by imagination. Their father gone, the young men dug and they delved, they ploughed and they harrowed. They found no direct treasure, but they obtained what was more to the purpose-white crops and green crops, and mangold­wurzel and swedes in great abundance. Such was the realization of the old man's promise. Not one, but each of his sons discovered the treasure, and each appro­priated to his own particular use the pot of gold. Now, could we persuade the great bulk of Irishmen that in some one province of their island there lies buried a Bill which has received the full assent of Queen, Lords, and Commons, and which, atnong other things, provides that there shall be granted to Ireland ten millions sterling per annum, for an indefinite period,-with a large percentage to the fortunate finder, we should convert them at once into the most industrious nation on the surfac3 of the!EJarth. The landlord and the conacrer, the priest and the Thug, would shoulder the spade in concert, and the soil of the country be turned up as the Irish soil never was before. The willing labourem would not, indeed, light upon the :Bill, but they would find their country teem-, ing with the fruits of the earth in due season, and soon be ready to acknowledge that the results of steady industry are better than a Godsend or a wind-fall. Lord CLARENDON has done the best he can to persuade the citizens of his Celtio Barataria to set themselves honestly to work in the only way which promises anything like success. As is well observed by our correspondent, the LoRD-Lrnu­TENANT has seen that the only way to save the struggling farmers of Ireland from ruin is to rouse them to exertion at the crisis of their fate. It is no golden shower that would avail them in their need, even if the clouds which yield such rain had not long since been drained of their supplies. What would be the result to the people themselves if the govern­ment were to persevere in a system of almsgiving and public works, it would be easy to foretell. The moneys thus dis­bursed would be charged upon the unions, and every shilling of property in Ireland rateable to the poor-rate would become the subject of confiscation. We would, then, for their own sakes, impress upon such of the Irish public as have anything to lose by taxation the fearful responsi­bility they incur when they throw diffi­culties in the way of any scheme to rouse the farmers to exertion. The people of the three kingdoms will imffer in the end, that is very true, but the first victims will be the very men who are an impediment to improvement. The factious and dis­contented in Ireland cannot reach the public in general but through the sides of their own countrymen. There have been also forwarded to us reports from the practical instructors in husbandry,which, in themselves, perhaps, convey the fairest idea of the state of the west of Ireland, as far as agdculture is concerned. We take two or three instances at random. Mr.THOMAS MARTIN was appointed to . visit the baronv of Erris, in Mayo. Re thus describes ""part of his progress through the district. On the 20th of November he assembled some of Sir RICHARD O'Dm&ELL's tenants, and instructed them in green-cropping and particularly turnips. We would call the attention of those who assert that no practical benefit is to be derived from the mission of these ins!\'uctors to the next fact recorded by Mr. MARTIN. He describes himself as pointing out to his audience a field of turnips sown broadcast on ridges which was completely lost for want of proper cultivation. They told him they knew no better. They had never tried to grow turnips before. Is Lord CLARENDON, then, so far wrong in the estimate he formed of the ignorance of the people in agricultural matters i Mr. MARTIN describes himself as passing the day after he had indoctrinated this audience with the theory of turnips through a large tract of waste land which might be easily reclaimed. ""It has gravel banks so convenient,"" he writes, "" that boys with wheelbarrows could easily gravel ten perches a day."" Nothing is done-the Irish Agitator would tell you there is a want of capital. The gravel and the ""boys,"" however, are there.. Mr. YvALSH, another of these in­structor&, gives us a very sad account of the condition to which the poor people' are reduced in the neighbourhood of Kil­rush,in Clare. He saw crowds of labourers and small landowners with their children waiting for admission to the workhouse,: although so backward was the agriculture' of the country that they might well have. been employed. When it is asserted that the want of capital alone, and not the' want of skill, is the cause of the estrange-! ment between the people and the soil, we! find from these reports that the facts are! not so. The peasantry and small farmers' frankly confess their ignorance of the pro-1 cesses of agriculture, and show themselves anxious for improvement. This may bi said to be the general spirit of the reports' we have received from Mayo, Sligo,:.1 Connemara, Clare, Kerry, and Donegal.! 'l'o their honour be it spoken, the Roman:! Catholic clergy have in general shown:. themselves ready to give every assistance.1 in their power to Lord CLARENDoN's1 emissaries. Lord SLIGO has adopted anl opposite course, and gives as his reason; his strong conviction that the mission of., these instructors will not be attended.\ with any practical benefit to the people. ' We have repeated it over and ovei:i again, we look for no miracles from this,, measure of the LORD-LIEUTENANT. We) look for no miracles from any measure! that can be devised for Ireland.

"THE VALUE OF AN IRISH POOR t.AW. (LEADING ARTICLE, THURSDAY, DEOEi\[BER 23, 1847.) ~ Mr. H. GRATTAN has proved himself on at least one occasion since the meetingof Parliament a sensible and moderate man. It is on that account we are con­cerned he should attempt to damage the character and operation o,f the present Irish Poor Law, and encourage his countrymen in their extravagant demands on the Imperial Treasury. That law, as it now stands, is a step of incalculable im­portance ; so much so that, unless we are mistaken, it will hereafter be thought to compensate for the horrors of "" the Great Irish Famine."" n has a sufficient resemblance to our own to promise similar results. Putting imperfections out of the question, and admitting that the Irish as well as the English Poor Law might be better, we still say that both are infinitely better than the barbarous and inhuman denial of all public charity which Ireland till lately exhibited. It is a regular system, and insures some beneficial results besides the mere relief of distress. Cer­tainly nothing has contributed so much to the present state of English industrial society as our Poor Law ; and if Ireland is ever to be made like England, that will be one of the means. One obvious merit of a compulsory and effective system of charity is that it makes up for absenteeism, and for the moral defects and disabled finances of individuals, As a general rule, land­lordism is absenteeism. Throughout the whole of these islands the instances in which landlords reside are the excep­tions to the general fact. The owner of the parish seldom comes near it. He resides at his seat twenty or two hundred miles off, and is to be found either in town, or at Brighton, or abroad, or in the Highlands, or anywhere but on the soil whence his income is derived. Even if he did or could reside, the example of Ireland warns us that he might witness starvation two hundred yards from his stables or his kennels, while his horses and dogs were consuming good Christian food. In England, however, the Poor Law comes in to set all this right. Out of every thousand pounds that would otherwise go to the landlord, and never be heard of again, the overseer lays an embargo on one hundred, or three hundred, or, if necessary, more for the poor. Hence the burden of poverty does not fall exc!usively on the _resident and the kind. The main expense is equally shared by the absentee, the pitiless, and the spendthrift. Were the. landlord left to himself he would, perhaps, send a £5-note in reply to the importunate demands of the clergyman, and expect to see his name figure in the county pa1:1er in consequence, Instead of £5, however, he pays £100, and that long before he receives himself one sixpence of his rent. Whatever the landlord may think fit to give is in addition. One thing, too, is very cle1r-the larger the poor's-rate the inore is got out of the absentee. We have no wish to see him or any man plundered in the name of charity ; but if tho poor happen to be numerous, and there a1'e very large demands, then a good Poor Law is the only engine that can effectually reach him. It was, then, a singular perversity of reasoning that led Mr. GRATTAN to as.sign absenteeism as an argument against a good poor's-rate. We could scarcely believe our eyes when we saw it stated so broadly as he put it at the last sitting of the House:­ '' The compa1'ison between the burden of the poor-rate in England and Ireland was scarcely fair, considering that so much money was carried out of Ireland by the absentee landlords in this country. If they sent back the money taken away by the rich proprietors, the Irish would be as able to pay poor-rates as the English were ; but; after taking away the rich proprietor, and exhausting the poor proprietor who remained, it was rather un­fair to taunt Ireland with paying only8d. in the pound, while England paid ls. 7d. If they did not take care of the operation of the out-door relief clause in the Poor Law Bill, the Irish resident proprietors would be brought to poverty and dis­tress, and the result would be that they would come over here as the French refugees did after the revolu­tion, and we should have to give them a shilling a day to maintain them."" Now, in what other way can we"" send back the money"" taken away by'the rich proprietors so effectually as by a good Poor Law ? The Irish orators tell us that £6)000,000, or even £8,000,000, are annually drained from Ireland in the shape of rent. We suspect that they possess very few data for that estimate, ~nd speak very much at random. Taking the lower sum, however, we have half the mteable value of Ireland carried out of 'it, as Mr. GRATTAN says, by the absentee landlords, who, however, do not reside by any means exclusively in England, but are also to be found in shoals at Paris, at Rome, and elsewhere. Mr. GRATTAN is as indignant as we can be at the _spec­tacle, and cries out, "" Send us:back their money."" We do send it back. How? In a poor's-rate. The collector, whatever his Irish title may be, stops the money at the agent's gate, and takes out of the .bag the poor man's pence. It is idle, then, to urge in the same breath that Irelimd cannot maintain its own poor, because its funds are insufficient, and yet that the absentee saclrs six or eight millions. Here is a plan for talring half that money, or rather half that value of Irish produce, and detaining it for the poor. Yet we are told that an Irish Poor Law is only feeding a hungry dog wibh a joint of his own tail. A moiety of £6,000,000 is something more than the joil!lt of a dog's tail, and, in the present instance, it has already been detacned from the-absentee, and a Poor Law reunites it to the hungry beast. Or, rather, when the absentee has the tail of his -prey .already between his teeth, we compel him to a partial sur­render of the mouthful. But, says Mr. GitATTAN, the Irish resident proprietors will be brought to poverty anil distress by this law. How ? By a law whicn compels the absentee to share with the resident the cost of humanity? The grievance, however, is in the amount. Hitherto, during the very few vears there has been a Poor Law at all, Ireland has usually paid. about 8d. in the pound, while England has paid ls. 7d. We are faking Mr. GRATTAN's figures. Is it, then, an intolerable hard­ship to ruin a man,-to bring him to the dogs,~to drive him into banishment, and make him a pauper, if we exact from him ls. 7d. in the pound on his rent.al! Why, there's 18s. 5d. left, which is no despicable change out of.a sovereign. But what if other rates and charges ran the drawbaJk up to 5s. in the pound, then 15s. in the pound on the gross rental is , ery fair net income. But Mr, DEERING's answer fully meets the complaint, and is perfectly true :­ '; With reference to the remal'ks which had been made respecting the different ratings for the poor in Engla;nd a:nd Ir~ land, he begged to say that in tho 27 parishes which conatituted the borough he reprP-sented (Aylesbury) the a;verage poor-rate was 6s. in the pound. (Hear, hear.) He was quite certain it was as high as 6s. 6d. In his own parish. When the Irish gentl1Jme11 were rated to that extent, it would be time enough for them to come over and ask his cou- L 2 stituents to contribute to their relief. (Hear.)"" In other words, first try the Poor Law. See what it will do. Levy the same rates that we do in this country. Make all the recipients who can work, work for their money. When you have done your best, then let us see what more is wanting, and wherein the law is defective. It will then be time, to see what supplementary mea­sures may be required. But so long as the poor's-rate is only a third or a quarter of what ia paid with tolerable cheerfulness in this country, it is simply ridiculous for the Irish proprietor to cry out, "" Oh, murder ! I'm ruined !"" We do not give ourselves up for lost simply because the overseer comes upon us for a second nine­penny rate in the year. be re­ of",THE VALUE OF AN IRISH POOR t.AW.,2,12/23/1847
"AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION IN IRELAND. (LETTER TO THE EDITOR, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1847.) Sir,-The success which has attended Lord Clarendon's Practical Instructors in Ilusbandryisgratifyingintheextreme;itis, in fact, the only cheering prospect which I have yet seen in the disastrous history of thiscountry,andwhich,ifproperly followed up, might lead to the most important consequences. Amid all the revolting accounts that reach you from this country, it is SB,tisfactory to see one movement prospering in the right direction, and 11mall though this effort may appear at first, yet I trust I shall see it officially re­eognized, and become one of the pre­manent institutions of the land. It appears that there are now 10 of these practical instructors engaged in the remote. and helpless districts of the south and west of Ireland. Where the locality evidently could not contribute to the ex­pense, their services are free, and whe;e the proprietors of any particular district subscribed one half for the purpose, the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society -0ontribi1ted the other half, and provided a.competent person to act as Instructor. By the,e means the interest and co-opera­tion of the locality have been secured, ,and active and efficient men established under the control and direction of head­-quarters. The cordial reception which these men have almost invariably re­0ceived, is strong evidence of their utility and of the demand for their exertions, 11,nd I refer with pleasure to their reports, by which it appears that they have been everywhere well received by the Roman Catholic clergy, who gave them every co­operation and assistance. This is deoi­dedly the most important feature in the movement, and when it is considered that this is the first time in which practical instruction has been tried among the remedies for the social evils of Ireland, it is gratifying that the attempt should so favourably received and promise to be so successful. There is certain executive machinery in Ireland, that, if judiciously combined with voluntary and individual exertions, might be productive of the happiest sults ; but, unfortunately, the efforts Government have been hitherto conducted with a reckless indifterence to the real wants and resources of the country. It is really melancholy to look tack upon the doings of the last two years, and to com­pare the profitless expenditure of public money, labour, and time, with what might have been done if the same had been properly and judiciously directed. The sensible and thinking portion of the community foresaw all this, ai;d pro­tested against it, but, unfortunately, their 1warnings, Cassandra-like, were neglected, and passed unheeded by, so that the old proverb of "" Quicquid delirant Reges, plectuntur Achivi"" still prevails, and whatever follies our rulers perpetrated . the poor Irish were sure to suffer for them. Thanks, however, to the wisdom, judg­ment, and energy of our present viceroy, there is some chance now that these gigantic errors will be henceforth avoided. Of an age and experience to qualify him for public business, he combines the most active exertions with a natural disposi­tion.to do what is right, and the public feel confident that no more of thes9 dis­astrous blunders will be inflicted on them, from which thev and the whole united community are now suffering so S9Verely. With that foresight and intelligence which marks the statesman, L~rd Claren-, don saw that the only way to rescue the depressed and struggling farmers of Ire­land from ruin was to. stimulate and to instruct them, to rouse them to exertion at the present critical moment, and by one combined effort to awaken them to a sense of their self-dependence. He saw that to persevere in a system of elee­mosynary relief or badly managed public works, would only perpetuate the evil, and end in the total demoralization of the country ; and that the only hope was to appeal to the people themselves, and, by convincing their understandings, to force them to exertion. In that attempt the efforts of the noble lord have fortunately been attended with unexpected success. Ten active and intelligen'b men are now employed in so many districts of the south and west of Ireland in stimulating and instructing the farming classP-s ; and, small though the number may appear at first, compared to the wants and resources of the country, yet it is incredible to con­ceive the practical and beneficial effects that have been already produced by their exertions. These men furnish reports weekly to the council of the central society,and they form,without any doubt, the most accurate and interesting account of the actual state of things in the i'bral districts at present. Their instructions are to go about from place to place, and point out to the farmers the great advan­tage to be derived from digging and turn. ing their land, and exposmg it to the effect of frost during winter ; they also point out to them that they can no longer rely for subsistence upon the cultivation of potatoes and grain alone, but must seek, by more varied culture, to supply those wants which are now become so emergent ; and they instruct them in the cultivation of those vegetables and green crops which have hitherto been totally unknown in these neglected districts. It is really gratifying,though painful,to read the accounts these men give of the state of the small farms in the wesi; of Ireland, and the efforts they make to follow their instructions ; though almost starving at the present early season, and depending in many cases on a scanty supply of roots and vegetables for food, they still obey the Qall, and turn with eagerness to cultivate the land which .they never thought of touching so early before. The instructors also state, that, on their returning to .any particular locality which they had previously visited, they saw evident symptoms of the parties having profited by their advice, and that the land appeared abso­lutely red from being tu!'ned up, whicb. formerly was never touched until spring began. To those acquainted with hus­bandry the importance of this process must be manifest, and I am happy to hear that it is the intention of the Council to retain these men during the winter months, in order that they may be pre­pared to impart additional instructions to the same parties in cultivating their lands when spring approaches. Here, then, is a system quietly and substantially established that involves the greatest principle connected with the management of Ireland -namely, the practical instruction of the farming classes, and the suocessful effort to stimu­late them to exertion. The progress, how ever, of this movement will depend en tirely upon the funds that will be avail­ble for the purpose, and I know of no pro­ject as yet started that so well deserves the confidence and support of the charit­able and philanthropic. While thousands are spent with questionable benefit in feeding the idle, from which no return is received, a few thousands may be now judiciously applied, at this critical junc­ture, in instructing these same people, and rousing them to exertion. A few benevolent individuals have'.hitherto con­tributed most liberally, but ~the fund at the disposal of the Council is totally in~ sufficient to produce any great or bene~. ficial effect, as 50 at least of these instruc­tors would be required before spring to effect any substantial ill)pression upon the helpless and neglected outcasts they have to deal with. I trust sincerely, therefore, that the noble efforts of Lord Clarendon will be supported, as they deserve, both by the State and by voluntary contributions ; that the importa.nce of the movement will be fully 1 ecognized and hailed as tho dawn of happier days for Ireland ; that while every constitutional effort shall bo made to pm1ish the wicked and coerce the strong, the real causes of our social evila shall not be lost sight of, and every exer­tion made to remedy and relieve them. Already a movement has been made from the boards of different Poor Law Unions who have felt the benefits of the system, to extend its advantages and to make them permanent ; and numerous memo­rials are being presented to his Ex­cellency from these bodies, calling on him to follow up his views as the prac­tical instructor of the .Irish peasantry.. It is to be hoped, therefore, that these: appeals will be attended to, and ~hat justice will be tempered with instruct10n; for, it is the general opinion,. that if the, vindication of the law be not followed,b~ corresponding amelioration in the social taking advantage of the turn of the tide, and domestic condition of the people, the which now appears to be at its lowest same endless state of coercion. and resist­ ebb, and which if properly directed might ance will be perpetuated which has dis­ still lead onward to comparative pros­ graced the annals of this country for ages perity and improvement. back. .An opportunity now occurs of Dublin, Dec. 19.

"REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR IRISH DISTRESS. Mr. T. C. Foster, Q.O., who w~s in­structed, in 1845, as The Times' Commis­sioner, to investigate the condition of the l)eoJ?le of Ireland, at the conclusion of his mquiries expressed his views of pos­sible remedial measures in the following letter:­ "" I have just finisheda careful examina­tion of the numerous letters which I have written to yoµ from Ireland, having entered on that examination anxious to rerresh my memory with the impressions which those letters contained, prompted by each locality from which they were written. I assure you that I rise from the task d~pressed by the almost unvary­ing evidence which they bear of neglected caJ?abilities, of want of energy, enter­ pr1se, and industry-of misery and degra­dation. To grapple with these monster :evils is, indeed, a terrible task ; but these are the evils with which the Govern­ment must grapple if it hopes to see Ire­land no longer a stumbling-block and a difficulty-alike the weakness and the dis­grace of the empire. "" Want of employment is the first 1superficial want which presents itself. It )is, however, a want which is more imagi­na,ry than real. Employment abounds ; but there is the want of energy and the want of industry to set about finding em­;ployment. Want of capital to give em­ployment is the first cry with which you a.re met. But it is enterprise and"" industry which creates capital. Capital is wealth accumulated ; and wealth can increase only in proportion as the produce of the. labour of the community is greater than 'its consumption. Labour is the first price -the original purchase-money which was paid for all things. ' Labour is the source of all wealth.' It is, then, to the want of industry that we must attribute tbe want of capital. But the statesman will ask, almost in despair, 'Row can you make a nation industrious which is steeped in apathy and laziness ¥' It is the business of a statesman to try-and the task is worthy of a statesman. "" It is at once conceded that the Government cannot find E:mployment for a nation. Employment for the mass of the people must spring from the people. That which the Government can do only, is to aid the people, to stimulate them, to lead them, to protect them in finding employment. The question, then, arises, how are these things to be done 1 I know the appearance of egotism-the seeming prAsumption-of writing to you what may be done to reclaim a people. Th:ire are quacks in abundance, each with his nostrum ; I may be esteemed a quack. After, however, having 1::een all ove.r Ireland-after having written on every subject which is talked of in it, and prepared laborious details on every subject-after having had no common advantages, having always had the oppor­tunity of mixing with the best informed society in each town and county, I humbly submit to you the opinions which I have formed. I believe them to be well-founded-test them ; if you find them worthless, reject them. "" The want of industry of the mass of the people is but partly their fault. It is partly owing to thei~ natural disposi­tion, and partly to their want of know­ledge, and the want of _opportunity of beirig industrious. .Again, the want of knowledge and the want of opportuni­ties of being industrious are faults which must be laid at the door of the middle and upper classes. It is for them to guide and teach those below them, and find them the opportunities of industry. Strictly speaking, there is hardly what can be termed a ' middle class ' in the country, looking at it as a whole. The middle class man in England is the most useful member of society ; along with considerable physical activity and exer­tion, he is perpetually striving with all the energies of his mind to accomplish some useful object-which gives employ­ment and creates wealth. He is either a merchant, a manufacturer, a farmer, or a shopkeeper. Each gives his energies and his skill to make the business in which he is engaged succeed. Excepting parts of the north of Ireland, and two or three of the principal towns, the middle class man in Ireland is what is termed a ' middleman '-a perfectly useless drone, apeing the manners and habitR of the class above him, living on a profit-rent which be neither uses skill nor exertion to enable his wretched under-tenants to realize. His superior knowledge never directs them. He is of no use in societv. On the upper class man, then, falls the duty of teaching the mass and finding them opportunities of industry. For the most part th1;1 upper classes almost en­ tirely neglect both thflse duties. And this fault i$ partly to be attributed to their negligence, partly to their embar­rassments, and partly to that unhappily prevailing system of .intimidation which drives them out of the country. How­ever well disposed, the mere nominal owner of an estate has not the power to promote improvements which give oppor­tunities of industry, and without the opp:irtunities of industry the people can­not learn to be industrious. However able and well-disposed, the man who is placed in apprehension of his life will leave to agents the duties of his position, and the door for neglect and abuse is at once opened ; and neglect and abuse but aggravate the evils which prevail. ""What measures, then, would such a state of society dictate to a statesman 1 Remember that individual likings and pre­judices,-nay, that individual interests, must give way to the interests of the nation. We cannot expect improvement to spring from the mass-from the com­mon people ; not only is this true of all nations, but in Ireland it is contrary to the national character for the mass of themselves to improve. They are con .tented with potatoes. Remedial measures must, then, be directed to the middle and upper classes-must be fitted to meet their peculiar relations and positions, under which now the opportunities of knowledge and employment cannot arise -for from the middle and upper classes must improvement spring. "" Of what use is the 'middleman 1 ' If he usurp the place of landlord, while in reality he is not landlord, give reality tq his position ; compel him to become the landlord, or to give np his position. If he take the place of an extortioner, and as an idle drone consumes the surplus produce-the wealth and capital of the community-extinguish him ; put an end by law to his abilitytocontinue todoso. In fact,create a valuable middle class bypr6­hibiting absolutely all subletting and thus compel the middleman either to purchase the fee, or become, as in England, a work­ing farmer of the lands which he holds, :finding capital and intelligence and skill to employ and direct labour on his lands. What would be thought in Suffolk, for in­stance, 0f any man who should go there and take a dozen farms, as Mr. O'Connell does in Kerry, and sublet them to small tenants at three times the rent which he himself paid, he doing nothing but receive the rents 1 It wo,ild not be borne ; but, if borne, it would soon make Suffolk what the farms of Mr. O'Connell are now­an abode of wretchedness and neglect. It is true that the Government can­not well compel the negligent among the upper class to attend to the duties of their position by direct means ; but they may by indirect means. Whatever tends to raise the tone, the expectations of society will compel the negligent among the upper class to meet those expecta­tions. Such utter neglect of all the duties of a landlord, such contrivances to insure rent, and such unscrupulous .means as are resorted to to realize it, as are sometimes met with in Ireland, society would not bear in England. For instance, it is common in almost all parts of Ireland to let lands in partnership. In the north and west this is called 'rundale,' or ' common,' and the tenants occupy in common, and, of course, the best tellant will take care not to do more than the worst, as he would only be working for the benefit of others and not for himself. If he drain and make a piece of land rich for himself one year, another of the rundale tenants gets it in rotation the next year, and reaps the benefit of his labour. This would not be endured in England,; but it arose from a landlord's contrivance to make a whole batch of tenants jointly liable for each individual's rent. In Tipperary the same system is extensively pursued, under the name of ' partnership ' holdings. There the tenants do not hold in com­mon, but divide their holdings. Half a dozen tenants will take a tract of land, and become jointly and severally liable for the whole of the rent, and divide the land among themselves. If one tenant does not pay his portion, the remedy resorted to is not to distrain his stock, for fear of rescue, but to proceed by ejectment ; but, in order to eject him, declarations in ejectment must be served on all the tenants who are joined in partnership with him. It is true that. they usually club up the money somehow or other, but is it possible to imagine any management more likely to create disorder than this Y In England society would not suffer it­would compel, in fact, the landlord thus negligent of his duty to alter such a management of his estate. Negiigent landlords must improve-must attend to their duties, if the expectations of society are raised. But the mass oHrish landlords donot afford opportunities for employment and instruction, because they are so em barrassed that they cannot. They have merely nominal estates-the real owners of their lands are mortgagees. No on can doubt the advantages which the upper elassesareable to confer on society. Society wants an upper class. But it must have it in reality-in substance, not merely in name. Nor does it matter who the indi­viduals are who compose the upper class so long as they are men of education, of honour, and of wealth. What matters it to society whether the lord of 50,000 acrns be lineally descended from the treacherous scoundrel Dermot Mac­murrough, or from a respectable cheese and bacon factor of Cork, or yarn-spinner of Belfast, who realized a fortune by his industry half a century ago. It is the man society wants ; and in that man the power of doing good-the wealth to give opportunities of industry, the knowledge to direct those opportunities, the honour to act justly and to set an example to all. But if you have a mere nominal landlord -a man over head and ears in debt and embarrassments, you lack in him the first and most needful quality, the power of doing good. Take measures, then, to give to society that which it wants to stimulate it and direct it-a real and not a nominal owner of the lands. Facilitate the transfer of lands. Enable an en­cumbered proprietor to sel 1 a part of his estate to pay off his encumbrances, giving the purchaser a clear title by Act of Par­liament, provided the purchase-money be paid over to the encumbrancers accord­ing to priority of claim. It is foreign to my object now to go into detail ; but let in the life-blood and energy, and enter­prise of capitalists into the lifeless masses of huge, encumbered, unimproved, help­less estates. They will become real owners of the land, will give employment upon H, and stimulate industry. Employment will bring peace. Industry will bring wealth. lh "" When an estate gets into such a hope­less condition that it can no longer pay the interest of its morteage debts and keep the owner, no longer permit a re­ceiver in Chancery to be appointed to receive the rents and hand them over to the mortgagee. The mortgagee has no responsibility, and no honour from the estate ; he cares nothing about it so long as his principal is secure and he gets his fnterest paid. The nominal owner has no power to do anything, and, however well inclined, the estate goes to ruin under his eyes. We may respect his attachment to his ancestral acres, and his dislike to part with them ; but we must not let his in­dividual likes and dislikes stand in the way of the public good. Ifhe cannot fnl­ti.l the duties of his position it is his mis­ fortune ; the State must take ct,re tlmt the community and the country do not suffer because of it. When this is the unhappy condition of an estate, at once compel a sale ; let in capitalists, and substitute a real for a nominal owner of the land. That which his good feeling, his inclination, or his good sense prompts, the real owner will have the power to carry into effect. "" There are, however, many landlords who have both the inclination and the power to benefit their tenantry-to give them opportunities of employment, and to instruct them, but who, owing to the disgraceful system of intimidation that is allowed to prevail, are driven out of the country. It is foolish to hope for im­provement if you do not enforce the law­if you do not give the consciousness of security for life and property to every man. The outrages and shootings of Tip­perary and some adjacent counties are dis­graceful to the nation-they mark the ex­istence among the people of the most cowardly and savage brutality. It is folly to apply to such a society the humane and moderate provisions of laws adapted only for a peaceful and orderly and in­dependent community. No man is in­dependent in Tipperary. He dare not act justly for fear of his life. However much he may hate the crime, he must shield the murderer for fear of his own life. He dare give no evidence calculated to lead to the punishment of an offender for fear of his life. He dare not turn away a servant that robs him for fear of his life. He dare not compel the fulfilment of a con­tract, or enforce the payment of a debt. for fear of his life. Nay, he dare not express a political opinion adverse to the prevailing mob opinion forfearof his life. For the Lord-Lieutenant to talk of putting in force the Ia.ws in such a state of society as this-of summoning juries who will not convict, and subpcenaing witnesses who will not give evidence, is childish. A free and liberal Government -mild and humane laws, which depend as much upon the co-operation and aid of the people, as upon the law or the Government, are only fitted for an en­lightened and orderly and just commu­nity ; they are helpless and mischievous in a cowardly, a savage, a brutalized, and an ignorant one. Such a people will bear and require a more despotic rule. Fine the community for every crime, and enforce the fine. If crime still goes on, send another thousand policemen into the county1 and make the county bear the whole expense. Billet the police in the farm-houses, and let them worm out crime in a manner fitted to the cautious and timid character of the people. The man who dare uot go to the police-office and give information ofa murderer willhint it to the policeman billeted in his house, because he will not be suspected of giving the information. Appoint stipendiary magistrates for every district, and it would be wise to extend their powers where juries will not convict. If a criminal is sentenced to transportation, pack him off at once ; do not give him time in gaol to leave behind him among his friends a legacy of revenge. Punish every brutal crime with a fitting penalty. What cares the man who can gloatover revenge, p3rpetrated or determined on, for a three months' imprisonment 1 Cat-o'-nine-tail him at a cart's tail through the chief town of his neighbourhood-hold him up to the sc'.lrn and derision of his neighbours for having been a cowardly brute, with just courage enough to skulk behind a hedge, and try to shoot an unconscious victim, or knock him senseless with a stone from behind. At the termination of his im­prisonment give him a repetition of the same dose, and send him home to his friends to doctor his back for him. A few such examples as these would have a thousand times greater effect than all the rewards and ~proclamations in the world. Strive bYl:;overwhelming force to make the punishment of crime certain, and make its punishment terrible.. If an outcry 1s raised against you by vagabonds and the press o~ the ' Vindicator ' class, never mind, it ; uphold what is good in the community, and the clamour of the worthless will not injure you. "" With a firm and determined hand put down agitation, whether that agita­tion be Orange or Repeal. If necessary, fear not to do it despotically. Remember you are dealing with a people who in the mass are almost uncivilized. Like children, they require governing with the hand of power. They require authority, and will bear it. A more enlightened community would not require it, and would not bear it. Rigorously put down all combina­tions and punish the combinators. It is a remarkable fact that there is scarcely a trade which has prospered in Ireland, save that of brewers anddistillers. Almost every other trade has been ruined by com­binations. One brewerandonedistiller, with a few unskilled labourers,are sufficientfor a brewery or distillery, and tha.e can, therefore, be no combinations. o~ skilled workmen against them. For instance­and I name these only as examples amid hundreds-a timber merchant of Dublin, Mr. James Fagan, erected saw-mills. The sawyers combined against him and, be­cause he perEevered, murdered his head sawyer, Hanlon, in open day, in one of the most populous streets in Dublin. Mr. Fagan, however, had sufficient capital to enable him to persevere, and now moro ' pit ' men are employed in his saw-mills, because he has created a trade, than he employedsawyers before. The same gentle-. man leased a useless dock, intending to make it a graving dock for the repair of vessels, instead of sending them to Glas­gow or Liverpool to be repaired. His men combined, and refused to work ex­cept on certain terms and at certain times. '!'his he would not submit to, and he pro­cured Scotchmen as ship carpenters. About four months ago, while some of these men were working at a ship's side, on a stage suspended by ropes, some of the combinators got on board, cut the ropes, and precipitated the men into 16 feet of water. Their lives were with difficulty saved.; a Dublin magisterial Solon, before whom the fellows who attempted to murder these men were brought, satisfied himself and the law by simply binding them over to keep the peace. A Mr. ]'old$, a printer, about four years ago, rented a magnificent printing establish­ment in Dublin, and erected steam presses, to enable him to compete with the London printers. No sooner had he got contracts and was beginning to suc­ceed, than his men combined against him and began to dictate lterms to him, and the rules en which he should conduct his business. Determined not to submit to this, he procured English and Scotch. printers. Almost immediately afterwards his printing establishment was set fire t!> and burnt down, and thegrand jury found that it had been done maliciously. This gentleman's undertaking, calculated to give employment and benefit to the community, was ruined in consequence. It is only two moilths ago that the colliers of Slievardah coal mine, Tipperary, and also of Earl's-hill Colliery, and South Ballinastick Colliery, in the same county, worked by the Mining Company of Ire­land, combined to prevent the agents working them in the mannertheythought most advantageous, and shot one of the agents. The average labourer's wages in that district is 8d. to 10d. a day, while every colliery was earning from 2s. to 3s. a day. The company have been com­ pelled to suspend the working of these mines in consequence, and a large number of men are thus thrown out of employ­ment. I have before me a report, politely furnished to me by Mr. Strangman, of Waterford, in which that gentleman details the establishment of a Coast Fish ing Company there. There were but few fishermen, earning a precarious subsis­tence there, and it was said that the fish had deserted the coast ; the trade was de­clining. Four years ago a fishing company was established there, and a trawler of about 40 tons burden was purchased. I cannot do better than quote his own report of the difficulties every undertak­ing in Ireland has to encounter, first from the most stupid opposition, and eventually from ille_galcombinations :­ "" ' First, as our mode of fishing was novel in this quarter, we had to employ Englishmen until some of the natives were instructed ; an outcry immediately arose for bringing strangers when so many at home wanted employment. Then, when we told of the profits likely .to arise from this mode of fishing, some accused us of boasting, while others circulated a report that fishing was merely the nominal object, but that. smuggling was the real one. One class found fault with us for sending any fish to England until their wants at home were supplied. Others. complained of the high prices charged. Another set denounced us for taking the bread from poor men-for that we caught so much we should not leave any for others ; and, further, that the market would be so glutted, and the prices depreciated, that even if they did catch as much as they had donepreviou~ly they would not be remunerated for their labour, This latter was asserted by many who ought to have known better ; and; such being the case, it was no wonder that those poor men, who fancied their rights and mode of living would be in­fringed upon, were so excited as to threaten us if we persisted. These threats, of course, had no effect upon us, further than to explain how ill-founded those reports all were ; but it was of no use, and one night a party of them seized a new net, worth about £15, cut it in pieces, and threw it over the cliffs into the sea. We offered a reward of £50, and GQvernment £30, for the discovery of the perpetrators, but it was no avail ; for .though one of the men in our employ­,ment knew the parties, yet he stated he would prefer being turned off to giving us information, fearing the consequences to himself. These were very discouraging circumstances ; but this extreme violence brought matters more speedily to a con­clusion. An inspector from the .Fishery Board came down, and also a stipendiary magistrate. A meeting was held, and an investigation entered into. The Roman Catholic clergy also exhorted their flocks, and, after some time, peace was restored. Since that time other parties have procured similar boats, and there are now 12 cutters of 40 to 50 tons burden, each belonging to this port, regularly engaged in this branch of fish­ing, besides sometimes as many as 20 more from other places, who occasionally visit us. The good wages the men earn has quite altered the current of public opinion, and those who were beforehostile to us are now anxious we should get more boats, and thus give more employ­ment, The apprehension of the fish being all caught has proved fallacious ; and, so far from this market being glutted, H is found the demand has increased with the supply, fish having become an article of regular diet. The cost of one of these cutters, with her gear, &c., is £500 ; and the value of the gross produce of .the fish taken by each of our boats is about £400 per annum. If, then, we suppose the other boats have been equally successful, the 12 boats, at £400, would clear £5,000 worth of good, nutritious food, drawn from the ocean, by this means giving so much wealth to the community ; and there is abundant opening for three times as many boats in this branch alone. The men receive certain proportions of what the fish sells for; The earnings of our skippers or captains average about 25s. per week, the men from 16s. to 21s., and boys 7s. to 10s. per week ; and, after paying for wear and tear,the owners divide about 20 per cent. per annum. With t,his pleasing result, I feel no hesitation in stating it as my opinion that the sea is a rich mine, which only requires to be judi­ciously worked to yield abundant reward for labour and capital-in other words, riches. Besides the traw I-fishing, our com­pany were anxious to introduce improve­ments in other modes ; and we began with lobsters, crabs, and prawns. We procured a suitable boat and apparatus, costing about £40, and two qualified hands. The summer before last this boat caught upwards of £100 woTth, the men earning 30s. per week, while employed, and the owners dividing 50 per cent. The last summer, however, we have met with sad d1!;appointments. Our previous sue­ cess excited much envy, and several of our pots were destroyed. We offered a large reward, but without effect. At first the partiea cut the apparatus ; but latterly they adopted an ingenious mo<le by which they conceive they can ease their consciences as well as escape punishment. The lobster pots are put in deep water about a mile or two from the shore,with a buoyorfloat on the surface to indicr.te their position. The plan resorted to is to get a piece of cord, about a yard long, with a stone tied to each end, This is dropped, ""accidentally on purpose,"" sad:Ue-wise on the float, which, being unequal to sustain the weight, is sunk to the bottom, and consequently defies all attempts at recovery. In consequence of these repeated losses I fear we shall be obliged to give up this branch, although we offered to the parties we have reason to believe were the perpetrators to pro­cure similar apparatus for them at cost price, and instruct them in the proper mode of using it, Last summer we found the sea to be absolutely alive with herrings, mackerel, and pilchards, from one-half mile to.six miles seaward frdm .the coast, but there being no sufficient or suitable boats or nets to take them, owing to the opposition and prejudices of the people, the advantage was entirely lost, with the exception of a very small quantity that came in cl0se to the shore..' "" It is melancholy to contemplate a stupidly ignorant opposition to enterprises like these from a people starving for want of employment. The Government, then, as -a first duty, ought to protectevery enter­prise by the most stringent and deter­mined e,1forc. ment of the law, and secure to tho rrnjeot,,rn the fair rewards of their enterprise, and with it employment for the People. The people themselves a!'e too apt to mistake cunning for wisdom ; and the cuµning which delights in the cleverness of ruining a rival, or forcing terms and rules on a speculator which his business will not bear, has not the wisdom to see that in ruining a rival it ruins a trade by which it lives, and that its forced terms have stopped the specu­lation which was its only livelihood. Insure by law payment to a tenant for those improvements which have increased tho value of the landlord's land, according to a fair estimate of the increased value, This fa simply honest and fair. The landlord loses nothing, for he has the in­creased value for his money, and the tenant will thereby be encouraged to improve. "" These are indirect means of insuring employment and prosperity. But there are other direct means which are in the power of the Government. "" Provide suitttble piers and harbours for the 1wcommodation and safety of the fishing craft. This would be a direct en­couragement to industry, and would leave laziness in sight of an abundance of fish without an excuse, On the coast of Erris, in Mayo, of parts of Connemara, of Donegal, of Kerry, and of the west of Cork, the sea swarms with fish, which often cannot be taken because there are no harbours of refuge. If a Donegal or Erris man ventures to sea, he does it at his peril, if the weather is at all doubtful, because there is no harbour to which he can run. And yet these people periodi­cally starve with swarms of fish beside them ; and are fed by the money of Eng­land, which would already have twice over built all the piers and harbours they wanted, and have ena,bled them inde­pendently to earn their own food. ""With the revenues of the Crown lands, lease, or purchase, and promote the draining and cultivation of waste lands. These would act as public ex~ amples to capitalists who might become purchasers; for it is from them that general improvement must come. The Govern­ment can only set examples, it cannot cultivate the whole country. 'rhis would cost nothing, but would, on the contrary, pay well. "" Establish in different districts model farms and agricultural schools to teach and instruct the peasantry, by both pre­cept and example, how to cultivate the land and make the most of those advan­tages they have. '' Attend to reasonable applications for assistance made by enterprising portions of the community. This would encourag!3 and urge them on. Limerick, for ill,!< stance, complains that she has no dock-; that her trading vessels are in danger of being driven against the bridge, and, in fact,. have been thus destroyed ; that the navigation of the Lower Shannon to the sea, which is now dangerous and full of shallows, might be improved at small ex­pense, while the liberal grant of £600,000 by the Parliament of Great Britain is being jobbed away in improving the Upper Shannon, and not one farthing is spent on the Lower Shannon. The citizens of Belfast complain that, with a. trade that yields a Customs revenue of £360,000 a year, the Government will not aid them to build a Custom-house for the convenient transaction of business and the collection 'of the Queen's taxes. They complain, also, that their repre­sentations about their insufficient Post­oJiice establishment ate totally disre­garded, and that the enormous com­mercial undertakings of that city are put to continual losses and inconveniences in consequence, Attention to matters like these is one of the routinedutiesofGovern­ment and effects much good. Inattention to them excites discontent, and depresses and heats down enterprise. "" Now, every one of these measures is practicable. Every one of them would tend to benefit, to encourage, to stimu­late the people ; to excite emulation, enterprise, and industry. Yet every one of them is neglected, Such measures would let capitalists into the country. The efforts of the Government at improve­ment and civilization would urge on those capitalists to imitate the example st1t to them, and they would have the power to do it. The peasantrywould be encouraged to be industrious, and would be taught how to be so. Compare any of these measures in probable benefit with the recent college grants. These grants are thanklessly received by the people. The colleges will teach young men Latin and Greek and theology, who had better be learning some honest trade by which to earn a living. Educated young men without means will lie thrown upon the world, to fill professions, and to become priests ; and these young men, penniless and disappointed, with cultivated minds, must become the seeds of future agitation. ""You complain of the turbulence of Ireland. The means of employment will stop turbulence. The measures which I have humbly suggested will promote­nay, insure-employment. ' Necessity and poverty,' said the great Lord Bale, in his plan for a reform of the English poor laws, ' and want of due provision for the employment of indigent per1<ons, and the custom of a loose and idle life, daily supply with advantage the number of those who are taken off by the sentence of the law ; and doubtless as the multi­tude of poor and necessitous and unedu­cated persons increases, the multitude of malefactors will inr,rease, notwithstand­ing the examples of severity.' 'The want,' says he, ' of a due provision for education and relief of the poor in a way of industry is that which fills the gaols with rnal.ifactors and fills the kingdom with idle and unprofitable persons that consume the stock of the kingdom with­out improving it, and that will daily in­crease even to a desolation in time, and this euor, in the first conception, is never remediable but by gibbets and whippings ; for there must be a sound, prudent, and resolved method for an in­dustrious education of the poor, and that will give better remedy against those corruptions than the after gain of penal­ties can.' What Lord Hale wrote of England in his time is true of Ire1anJ now. Give, then, that ' industrious edu­cation of the poor,' and those means of employment which the measures pointed out will insure, and Ireland-unhappy, neglected, agitated Ireland~will no longer prove ' the great difficulty ' of the English Government,""",REMEDIAL MEASURES FOR IRISH DISTRESS,2,12/30/1847
